Lionel Messi to leave PSG at end of season with French side not planning to offer new contract
Lionel Messi was suspended earlier this week by Paris Saint-Germain for going on a personal promotional trip to Saudi Arabia without permission;     the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner's two-year deal with PSG ends this summer and he is now set to leave the Ligue 1 side on a free transfer.
Lionel Messi will leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season, with the Ligue 1 club not planning to offer the forward a new contract.
Messi joined PSG in the summer of 2021 on a two-year deal after leaving Barcelona due to their financial issues.
The 35-year-old has played 71 times for the French side, scoring 31 goals, recording 34 assists and lifting the title in 2022.
Sky Sports News also understands PSG would be willing to listen to offers for Neymar this summer.
PSG condemned the actions of supporters who are understood to have gathered outside the home of Neymar and chanted for him to leave the club on Wednesday night.
Fans were filmed chanting for the board to resign outside club headquarters before further clips showed a group of supporters visit the home of Neymar and called for him to move on.
"Paris Saint-Germain most strongly condemns the intolerable and insulting actions of a small group of individuals that took place on Wednesday," a club statement read. "Whatever the differences of opinion, nothing justifies such actions. The club gives its full support to its players, its staff and all those targeted by such shameful behaviour."
What's next for Messi?
Messi's representatives were in talks over a contract renewal, with everything looking positive during the World Cup in Qatar, but the dynamic has now changed.
PSG consider the move to sign Messi to have been a success on and off the pitch, but sections of the club's fans turned on the player after they were knocked out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich.
Messi was also suspended by PSG earlier this week for going on a personal promotional trip to Saudi Arabia without permission.
The Argentina international is understood to have asked PSG for permission to travel to the country, which he did on Sunday night, having twice postponed a scheduled commercial trip due to team defeats.
However, Messi did not get that permission and was therefore suspended for two games and fined two weeks' wages after a day of meetings between the club's hierarchy.
Messi will now miss the Ligue 1 matches against Troyes and Ajaccio, but could return for the match against Auxerre on May 21.
The forward and the team have not been performing as well as expected since the World Cup and his departure in the summer will fit with the club's new strategy of focusing on young French players instead of signing superstar talents.
Messi still believes he can play at the highest level in Europe and Barcelona have made no secret of their desire to re-sign him this summer.
It remains to be seen whether they can afford to offer him a new contract but he is much more likely to stay in Europe than move to Inter Miami - or any other MLS club - or Saudi Arabia at this stage of his career.
Messi was pictured in Riyadh on Monday and advertised his presence in the country on his social media. Messi already serves as a tourism ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal want to sign Messi this summer and, with the backing of the country, are prepared to pay him an astronomical £400m for just one season in order to market a league that already contains Cristiano Ronaldo.
Tourism minister Ahmed Al-Khateeb tweeted a welcome to Messi on Monday, as well as posting pictures of the Argentinian only hours after he had played 90 minutes of PSG's 3-1 home defeat to Lorient.
"I am happy to welcome Messi and his family to Saudi to enjoy the magical tourist destinations and authentic experiences," Al-Khateeb tweeted. "We welcome visitors from all around the world to experience a unique trip to Saudi Arabia and its hospitality.
Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:
"Paris is the city of love but this affair between Messi and PSG is ending in a very acrimonious way.
"PSG signed Messi on a two-year contract with the option of a third year and they’ve decided they’re not going to take that option.
"There had been talks over a new deal but I think PSG had made it clear to Messi that perhaps they don’t value him as highly as he values himself.
"As far as PSG are concerned, this is a natural time to end his time in Paris. They are moving in a different direction - they want to end the ‘bling-bling’ culture.
"As far as Messi is concerned, he didn’t want to particularly leave Barcelona two years ago. He’s had a pretty good time in Paris but I don’t think he’s in love with the city, and he’s not in love with the club. He feels there are other options that are far more lucrative.
"He would love to go to Barcelona. His father, who acts as his agent, let Barcelona know he wasn’t going to sign a new deal with PSG."
Barcelona have already attempted to step up their efforts to make Messi a contract offer this summer by talking to LaLiga about generating more flexibility in their Financial Fair Play ratio.
The club are in talks with the league regarding their spending limits for next season, with the idea firmly in mind to try to bring Messi back to the Nou Camp for what is likely to be his last year in European football.
However, it will not be easy with Barca having been charged by LaLiga for breaching their limit with three players during the 2021-22 season, including ex-Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen, and were forced to re-register Gavi as an academy player.
The Christensen fine has been successfully appealed but Barca remain at the very limit of what they can spend and will almost certainly have to move players on to accommodate a Messi return.
Barcelona manager Xavi told reporters last week it was "too soon" to speculate whether Messi would return to the club, saying: "When it comes to Leo, we don't know if it will happen or not. It's too soon to talk about it.    "Winning the title is very important to us, for the club, the staff and the players. It would give us a lot of stability.
"As for new players arriving, we will talk about it once we've won LaLiga."

    Erling Haaland: Man City striker smashes Premier League goal record held by Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole
Manchester City striker Erling Haaland smashed all-time Premier League Golden Boot record of 34 goals in 42-game seasons set by Andrew Cole and Alan Shearer
Erling Haaland has smashed the all-time Premier League goal record after netting his 35th of the season in the 3-0 win over West Ham.
The Norwegian surpassed the shared record set by Andrew Cole and Alan Shearer of 34 goals in 1993/94 and 1994/95, respectively - both achieved nearly 30 years ago in 42-game seasons when the league was comprised of 22 teams.
The 22-year-old still has five league games remaining to extend the record-breaking tally, with his current goal ratio of 1.26 per 90 minutes suggesting he could finish the campaign close to 41.
The towering striker has scored more goals than five Premier League teams: Chelsea, Nottingham Forest, Wolves, Everton and Southampton.
Haaland has also registered four hat-tricks and remains only one shy of equalling Harry Kane's record of five in a single Premier League campaign - despite his last hat-trick coming more than three months ago, against Wolves in January.
In all competitions, the Norway international has also surpassed the half-century milestone with 51, leapfrogging Vic Watson and Pongo Waring on 50 goals - records set more than 90 years ago. Now, only Dixie Dean's all-time record of 63 goals from 1927/28 stands in his way.
City could still have nine games left to play if they overcome Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals to book their place in Istanbul on June 10. Based on Haaland's average goal rate across all competitions, he would match Dean's record - if he plays every minute and City beat Real across both legs.
Haaland's staggering achievements are made all the more impressive by the fact Golden Boot tallies have been on the wane in recent years, failing to surpass 23 in the previous four seasons.
Mohamed Salah last broke the 30 threshold back in 2017/18 during his inaugural campaign at Anfield, when his 32 goals set a new record for a 38-game season.
You can relive every goal scored by Salah, Shearer and Cole in those record-breaking campaigns below...
Despite his record-breaking returns, the Norwegian has clocked only 84 per cent of game time in the Premier League, 71 per cent in the Champions League, 40 per cent in the Carabao Cup and 41 per cent in the FA Cup.
That means he's played only 74 per cent of available minutes across all competitions this season and would be on more than 64 goals right now - if he'd played every minute and maintained his goal ratio.
Currently, Haaland is averaging at 1.26 goals per 90 minutes in the Premier League - seriously more potent than any other player in Europe's top five leagues this season to have played in excess of 612 minutes.
The chart below plots goals and expected goal returns for all Premier League players this season and presents the scale of the striker's form - soaring clear in both categories.
Several forwards from opposition teams are in consistent form, most notably Callum Wilson, Alexander Isak and Harry Kane - but Haaland is humbling his rivals' figures.
Some critics might claim any established forward would convert bags of goals in Pep Guardiola's side, based on the sheer quantity of clear-cut chances they create.
However, the Norwegian has also exceeded his expected-goal (xG) returns considerably, netting nine goals more than the 26 expected from chances presented to him - another league-topping ratio.
Additionally, Haaland has fired a league-high 56 shots on target, which means his current goal haul equates to one goal from every 1.6 shots on target - underlining the clinical finishing.
The shot map below highlights how City's No 9 has converted almost all of his goals from the central third of the opposition box, between the goal line and penalty spot.
In terms of shot placement, Haaland is prolific when firing low, to the left side of the goal - netting 19 of his 26 shots on target. He isn't too bad aiming to the right either, with eight scored from only 12 on target, while netting around half of his accurate strikes down the middle.
Haaland appears to be genuinely unstoppable when in full flow. His acrobatic and aerial ability, coupled with physical height, power and speed, is defying all attempts to nullify his powers - despite opponents being aware of his primary threat down the left-of-centre channel.
While City's title charge powers on, Haaland's current goal-rate sets him on course to finish the season out on his own with 41 league goals - but there is a growing sense he will rewrite the record scales entirely.

Napoli win Serie A: Luciano Spalletti's side win Scudetto for first time since Diego Maradona era with draw at Udinese
Napoli have secured their first Serie A title in over 30 years by drawing 1-1 at Udinese; this is the first Scudetto the southern Italian side have managed since 1990 and the Diego Maradona days
Napoli have sealed their first Serie A title since the Diego Maradona days after a 1-1 draw at Udinese.
Victor Osimhen's 22nd goal of the season ensured Napoli secured the single point needed to clinch the title with rivals Lazio and Juventus now no longer able to catch them in the remaining five games.
It ends their 33-year wait since Argentine great Maradona led them to two championships in 1986-87 and 1989-90.
Visiting supporters at the capacity Stadio Friuli held aloft banners adorned with the image of the late Maradona, eagerly anticipating the long-coveted Scudetto.
Udinese's Sandi Lovric dampened the spirits of Napoli fans when he scored the opening goal after 13 minutes, with a well-placed shot that found the top-right corner of the box.
But Osimhen sparked jubilant celebrations among the visiting fans when he fired in the equaliser from a rebound in the 53rd minute.
As the final whistle blew, Napoli supporters rushed onto the pitch to celebrate the momentous occasion alongside the players.
Udinese are based in Italy's north-east, more than 800 kilometres away from Naples, so many Napoli fans stayed home and watched the game at their local Maradona stadium, which was specially equipped with eight giant screens.

Jude Bellingham: Real Madrid in advanced talks to sign Borussia Dortmund midfielder
Real Madrid are in advanced talks to sign Jude Bellingham from Borrusia Dortmund; Sky Sports News understands a deal is yet to be agreed, with Manchester City still interested; Sky in Germany believe Dortmund would demand between £106m-£132m for 19-year-old
Real Madrid are in advanced talks to sign Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund but a deal is yet to be agreed.
Bellingham is set to be one of the most sought-after midfielders in the summer transfer window, with Manchester City also interested in the England midfielder.
But one source involved in the negotiations has told Sky Sports News he is confident that Bellingham will become a Real Madrid player this summer and the transfer fee will be a record for a British player.
Sky in Germany understand Dortmund have not received any offer for Bellingham, although it is understood that Dortmund would demand between €120-150m (£106m-£132m) for the 19-year-old.
Liverpool withdrew from the race to sign Bellingham earlier this year, with the club believing that paying upwards of £100m on just one player is not the right strategy to rectify the drop-off in form they have suffered this season.
Any potential move for Bellingham by Real is helped by the close and friendly relationship of the Spanish giant's president Florentino Perez and Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke.
Dortmund's sporting director Sebastian Kehl told Sky in Germany: "Our highest priority is the Bundesliga right now. We want to become German champions! Everything else comes second."
Bellingham, who has 11 goals and seven assists in all competitions for Dortmund this season and represented England at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, has been at the German club since the summer of 2020.
'Man City remain in hunt for Bellingham'
ky Sports News senior reporter Rob Dorsett:
"Jude Bellingham is the most exciting, and the most valuable, teenager in European and world football right now.
"You have to compare his quality to that of Kylian Mbappe when he was 18 - that's when the French forward joined PSG for £166m in 2017. That figure gives important context.
"However, Bellingham has two years left on his existing Dortmund contract. That will reduce the asking price a bit, because Dortmund will be concerned that, if they can't tie him down to a new contract this summer, and if they don't sell him this summer, his asking price will be significantly lower, as he approaches the final year of his contract.
"Nevertheless, because of the quality of the player, his age - which means he is likely to improve still further - and the huge interest in him, Bellingham is still likely to cost well in excess of £100m. Probably more than £120m.
"At the end of the day, he will cost what Dortmund are prepared to accept as an offer for him, and we know there is no agreement between Dortmund and any other club in terms of fee - yet.
"We should point out that only a handful of clubs could afford to buy Jude Bellingham right now - PSG, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Manchester United and maybe Chelsea.
"Liverpool have already ruled themselves out because they know that if they broke the bank for Bellingham, they could sign no more players this summer.
"United remain interested, I'm told, but whether they can pursue a deal very much depends on what happens with the sale of the club, and whether there is new investment at hand.
"Chelsea have no manager, and are undergoing a major restructure behind the scenes. PSG have so far shown no active interest.
"That's why Real Madrid and Manchester City remain favourites to sign Bellingham this summer.
"If Real Madrid get Jude Bellingham, the hottest property in world football right now, it would be a heck of a coup for them. They already had two of the best young midfielders in world football in Aurelien Tchouameni and Eduardo Camavinga, 23 and 20 years old. If they get Bellingham, who is still only 19, that would be an extraordinary midfield by anybody's stretch of the imagination.
"If they get Bellingham, Real are planning for the future, it would be a heck of a signing and leave them with the most formidable midfield in world football.
"My understanding is Man City are very much still in the hunt for Bellingham, so you wonder how they will respond to this news that Real Madrid are in advanced talks. They've always been in the background and have the financial clout, albeit under the examination of the Premier League charge which is yet to be answered.
"My gut feeling is that it's going to be Manchester City or Real Madrid, and the news we're getting from our colleagues at Sky Germany would hint he's closer to going to Real than anywhere else, but the deal isn't done yet and that's absolutely crucial.
"I don't think this is done. It's a pretty significant story, but I wouldn't suggest any deal is done or close to being done, it's not. The people around Jude Bellingham have spoken to a number of Europe's elite clubs, including Man City, Man Utd and Chelsea, and I'd be surprised if they were willing to give up the chase at this stage."
'Real would be brilliant move for Bellingham'
Former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock speaking to Sky Sports News:
"I'm not shocked if I'm being completely honest. When Liverpool pulled out of the race, it was almost due to the fact they knew that Bellingham might go to Real Madrid.
"When Bellingham went to Germany, it tells you everything about his personality and the player: he wants to push himself, test himself, learn new languages and play for big clubs.
"You can't deny him going to Real Madrid, it is a magnificent club. It is steeped in history, tradition and everything about it.
"You look that the players who have gone before and what it is about - I think it's a brilliant move.
"I would love to see him at Liverpool, I really would.
"But you look at the move and think: what a brilliant move for such a young player to go to such a huge club.
"I think it frees up Aurelien Tchouameni, he's not played as much football as he would have liked at Real Madrid. Will Liverpool go back in for him?"
Sky Sports' Melissa Reddy writing in November 2022:
Real Madrid will position their offer to Bellingham - the most coveted young midfielder in Europe - as his opportunity to become the best player in the world at the place that breeds champions.
Real's charm offensive has already begun and there is great seduction in becoming core to, as the club executive calls it, "the next all-star midfield." Casemiro is gone, Luka Modric is 37, and Toni Kroos wants to retire at the Bernabeu even though he's aware he is part of the present and past but not the future.
Eduardo Camavinga, Aurelian Tchouameni and Federico Valverde will carry Real forward, with the hierarchy of Florentino Perez, Juni Calafat and Jose Angel Sanchez wanting Bellingham to be the golden thread.
They have the European royalty angle and have not been shy of pointing to Kylian Mbappe's misery this season following his decision to snub them and agree to an eye-watering extension at Paris Saint-Germain coated with an insane level of influence.
The France international was also told he would be front and centre for the Ballon d'Or if he joined Real, and would know how it felt to 'own the Champions League.'
Mbappe, the Spaniards say, opted for power and a swollen bank balance over "the sporting project" and it should serve as a lesson.
PSG do count a Ballon d'Or winner in Lionel Messi, but that is merely by virtue of him being registered at the club during the 2021 edition, which recognised his exploits with Argentina, and on a lesser level, Barcelona.

Neville: Boehly, you've created Chelsea mess, stop meddling
Gary Neville blamed owner Todd Boehly for Chelsea's "nightmare" season, saying he must "stop meddling".
Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, the Sky Sports pundit was critical of the way the American has made major changes to the staffing at Chelsea and taken on big football decisions himself.
"It all comes from the top," said Neville. "It's been chaotic, a mess since day one.
"Boehly has had a nightmare and misread this league. I'm sure he'll learn quickly. What has happened this season is purely down to him.
"He needed to keep the footballing department together. He's the non-footballing department. You're the owner. You're not a player or a coach. You've got no experience in this league so stay where you are and allow the people to run the football club [who have done so] successfully over the last 10 years.
"Try and get a year out of them to learn the ropes and keep the stability and consistency of Chelsea. Petr Cech left, Marina Granovskaia left, Thomas Tuchel was gone after a few games and all of a sudden you're in complete turmoil. Then they flipped it to a model giving eight-year contracts to 22-year-olds!
"When you start sacking groundsmen, physios, sports scientists, directors, managers, then you are throwing everyone under a bus saying, 'it's their fault not mine'... Chelsea had a successful way of running the club.
"This is now what Boehly has created. He created this mess. Like playing Football Manager, it's been terrible."
Mauricio Pochettino's appointment as Chelsea head coach is edging closer.
During negotiations, Chelsea's squad size and recruitment have been discussed as well as the make-up of Pochettino's backroom staff.
Talks have progressed positively between both parties but no formal deal has been signed yet.
Interim boss Frank Lampard is expected to be in charge for the remainder of the season.

Julian Nagelsmann: Tottenham held talks with ex-Bayern Munich boss in last few days - Sky in Germany
Tottenham held talks with Julian Nagelsmann in last few days - Sky in Germany; former Bayern Munich boss is interested in the Spurs job but no agreement or commitments have been made at this stage; Bayern are still demanding a transfer fee if the 35-year-old is to move
Tottenham have held talks with Julian Nagelsmann in the last few days over their managerial vacancy, according to Sky in Germany.
The former Bayern Munich boss is interested in the job but no agreement or commitments have been made at this stage.
Bayern, meanwhile, are still demanding a transfer fee if Nagelsmann is to move.
Sky in Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg understands Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is "pushing more" for Nagelsmann, who wants to know exactly how much power he would get in transfers if he was to become head coach.
Plettenberg also believes more talks will follow, while it is understood the German wants to take his time before making a final decision.
It is still unclear who will be the new managing director of football at Tottenham after Fabio Paratici resigned last month.
Sky Sports News has been told Johannes Spors is one of a number of sporting directors the north London club are looking at.
Spors is a global sporting director for a number of clubs, including Genoa, Standard Liege and Melbourne Victory.
Nagelsmann had previously held talks with Chelsea but he is no longer under consideration for the Blues' managerial vacancy with Mauricio Pochettino the frontrunner to take over at Stamford Bridge.
Nagelsmann, who was sacked as Bayern boss last month, was never regarded as the favourite for the job internally at Chelsea.
Friction between the two sides grew as Chelsea officials were determined to carry out a thorough due diligence on all of the candidates before making a decision - with the German coach resenting the repeated interviews and requests for information.
Nagelsmann had reservations over the role himself and sensed that Chelsea's varied shortlist, reflected a lack of clarity about the direction they want to take.
He had previously stated "it's important as a manager that you feel a club believes in you and your methods" and that it appeals to him "to work where the structure is clear, where there are not 20 guys all with an opinion that takes you in different directions".
Rangnick: Nagelsmann should go to Tottenham
Last month, Ralf Rangnick suggested Nagelsmann should go for the Tottenham job.
The ex-Manchester United manager, who mentored Nagelsmann at Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig, believes Spurs have the right set-up - but he would benefit with a sporting director with him.
Rangnick was sporting director for the Red Bull franchise of clubs, including Leipzig and Salzburg, between 2012 and 2015 and then again from 2019 to 2020.
"I think Tottenham is an exciting club in many ways," Rangnick said in the Sky Germany studio.
"They probably have one of the most modern, beautiful stadiums in the world at the moment. They have one of the best training centres, that is there at the moment and Daniel Levy, who has been leading the club for many, many years.
"Although he is not a big spender, he knows the football business and would not put himself in the centre of the cameras.
"If Tottenham really want him, then I think it would be important if a sporting director was still there to support him.
"It can be a very, very exciting story. There is room for improvement, a lot of room for improvement and yet this is not a club where the house expects you to be in the top one or two right away."
Bayer Leverkusen head coach Xabi Alonso has also emerged as a target for Tottenham as they search for a new permanent manager.
Sky Sports News understands key figures at Spurs admire the former Liverpool midfielder, who took over at Bayer Leverkusen in October.
In that time he has led the German club from relegation contenders to sixth in the Bundesliga and the semi-finals of the Europa League where they will face Jose Mourinho's Roma.
Spurs are also impressed by Vincent Kompany, who has guided Burnley back into the Premier League as Championship winners this season.
Spurs have yet to appoint a permanent successor to Antonio Conte, who left in March after a difficult end to his time in north London. Interim boss Cristian Stellini has already been and gone, with Ryan Mason now in a second spell in caretaker charge.
He will remain in charge at Spurs until the summer.
A run of four games without a win has seen Spurs' hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League slip away.
They sit seventh in the table, five points behind Liverpool in fifth having played a game more and nine points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester United, who also have a game in hand.
They also face a battle to qualify for either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League with Aston Villa, Brighton and Brentford still with hopes of securing European football.

Man City Premier League charges explained: What are they? What could punishment be? What's the timescale?
Manchester City charged by Premier League with numerous alleged breaches of financial rules; Premier League has referred the case to an independent commission; Man City are the reigning champions but find themselves second in the table, five points behind Arsenal
Manchester City have been charged with alleged breaches of financial rules by the Premier League - but what are they? How serious are the charges? And how long will this process take? Sky Sports News' chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol explains...
What are the charges?
Manchester City have been charged with breaking financial fair play rules around 100 times over a nine-year period, which starts in 2009 and goes on until 2018. You have to bear in mind that, during the period, Man City won the Premier League three times.
The Premier League's financial fair play rules are designed to ensure clubs pretty much spend what they earn. You can get around that potentially by inflating how much you're earning or hiding how much you are spending.
According to the Premier League, Man City allegedly broke the rules over nine seasons. They allegedly didn't provide accurate financial information.
Allegedly, they did not fully disclose the financial remunerations that were made to one of their managers over a four-year period. The suggestion is that there was a secret contract so one of the managers was getting paid much more than officially stated.
The Premier League also allege Man City didn't comply with UEFA's financial fair play rules over a five-year period. They also allege that Man City have not fully co-operated with the Premier League's investigation.
This is a very serious matter for Man City.
Time bar helped Man City during 2020 CAS case - will it work this time?
In the past when they've been investigated by UEFA, Man City have always insisted they have done nothing wrong. In February 2020, they were banned by UEFA from European competition for two seasons and also fined €30m (£26.8m).
Man City took that case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The ban was overturned and the fine was reduced to €10m (£8.9m). At the hearing, the panel found most of the breaches alleged were not established or the time was barred, which effectively means they happened too long ago for UEFA to do anything about them.
Crucially, Premier League rules do not include time bar so when Man City defend themselves, they cannot say these alleged offences took place too long ago for you to be able to do anything about them.
What are the differences between UEFA and Premier League rules?
Football finance expert Kieran Maguire speaking to Sky Sports News:
"The main difference between the Premier League and UEFA is UEFA have a statute of limitations, which limits the availability of evidence to five years. The Premier League does not have that.
"UEFA have rules in regards to where evidence comes from and it can't come from illegal sources. If you take a look at the Premier League handbook, it states that the source of data and evidence is an irrelevance as far as they are concerned, although this might form part of Man City's defence that some of the evidence which is going to be provided by the Premier League has come from inappropriate sources and there is a lack of credibility with that evidence.
"I suspect some of the evidence that is going to be put forward by the Premier League to the independent commission has ultimately come from the Football Leaks, Der Spiegel and the Portuguese hacker because that was quite comprehensive.
"It was part of the overall strategy of the Premier League gathering together evidence, especially when they felt it couldn't necessarily be obtained from the football club itself."
What are the possible punishments?
According to Premier League rules, it can be a points deduction or even the threat of expulsion from the Premier League, although I think that would be an extreme punishment.
But, if it was a points deduction, it would be a deduction that would be in the current season, so if they were found guilty in a future season, that's when the points deduction would be applied.
What punishments can the independent commission impose on a club?
Suspend a club from playing league matches
Points deductions
Recommend to the board that league matches be replayed
Recommend to the board that the league expels the respondent club
Order compensation
Cancel or refuse registration of players
Conditional punishment
Order the club to pay costs
Make such other order as it thinks fit
What do rival clubs make of it all?
Many Premier League clubs want City to be relegated if they are found guilty of breaking rules over nine seasons.
There is a feeling among top-flight clubs that taking away City's titles retrospectively would be meaningless and cause confusion, but a fine is also not likely to have much of an effect, either.
The clubs who had been pressing hardest for action until Monday were the other members of the so-called 'big six': Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham.
There will not be much sympathy for City, who have won the Premier League six times in the last 11 years, if they are found guilty.
Premier League clubs do not want to get involved in the process, which is in the hands of an independent commission.
Will it happen quickly?
I don't think it's going to be anything that happens very quickly so I would discount the chances of anything happening this season.
This investigation has already been going on for four years. This is something that is going to go on for a long time yet.
Will this play out in public?
In the Premier League rules, it says proceedings before an independent commission will be confidential and heard in private. We will not know anything about it.
Then, according to the Premier League rules, the commission's final award will be published on the Premier League's website. So we have no indication how long this will take, we will not be able to report on what is happening and we will only find out the final decision when it's published on the Premier League's website.
How did the investigation begin?
You have to bear in mind that the only reason this all came to light was five years ago, German outlet Der Spiegel published an investigation which was based on the work of a Portuguese computer hacker Rui Pinto, who had hacked into the email accounts of various football clubs and agents. It was this story that started the UEFA investigation into Man City, which also led to this Premier League investigation.
Man City issued a statement on Monday, which read: "Manchester City FC is surprised by the issuing of these alleged breaches of the Premier League rules, particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the EPL has been provided with.
"The club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position.
"As such we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all."
Can City appeal?
The independent commission will be formed of three members, who will be selected by Murray Rosen KC, the chair of the Premier League's judicial panel.
The three-person panel can include any of the 15 members of the judicial panel, as well as non-members.
Once a judgement is made, the Premier League and Man City will be able to appeal - although it cannot be taken to the CAS.
Instead, Rosen would appoint an appeal panel made up of new members. There are currently six members of the Premier League appeal panel.
Who will be on the panel?
Stephen Taylor Heath, JMW head of sports law, speaking to Sky Sports News:
"The commission will have a legal representative on the panel, and you'd expect that representative to be a pretty heavyweight King's Counsel.
"Manchester City have had an obligation to comply with the Premier League's investigation and they now have an obligation to comply with the commission's procedure. If they don't comply then a dim view will be taken.
"If the charges relate to administrative errors then the sanctions will be a slap on the wrist. You would think, if the Premier League have taken it this far, they either think there is a case to answer or they've simply got to the point where they haven't been given the answers, and they're now putting it to a commission to get those answers."
What could the ramifications be for other Premier League clubs?
Football finance expert Kieran Maguire speaking to Sky Sports News:
"If you talk to lawyers, they say it would be difficult for another club to say they lost a title or, perhaps more importantly, access to the Champions League and all the rewards that it brings.
"There was talk just 12 months ago about Burnley and Leeds potentially putting in a claim against Everton with regards to their financial scenario, although that was never crystallised.
"Everybody is going to be watching this with a huge amount of interest and once independent commission makes a judgement, things will move on from there."
Speaking in May 2022, Man City boss Pep Guardiola explained why he had backed the club after they were charged by UEFA with breaching financial fair play regulations.
"I truly, truly believe," he said. "Why did I defend the club and the people? It's because I work with them.
"When they are accused of something I ask them, 'tell me about that', they explain and I believe them. I said to them 'if you lie to me, the day after I am not here'. I will be out and you will not be my friend anymore.
"I put my faith in you because I believe you 100 per cent from day one."

Barcelona make Chelsea's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang top No 9 target; Liverpool's Roberto Firmino on shortlist
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Chelsea from Barcelona last summer for £10.3m; striker has scored three goals in 20 games, although only 10 have been starts; 33-year-old scored 13 goals in 24 games for LaLiga leaders during the second half of last season
Barcelona have made Chelsea’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang their top No 9 target this summer on a striker list that also includes Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino.
The LaLiga leaders want to re-sign Aubameyang, who made a lasting impression on the Barca dressing room during his spell at the club last year, as competition for Robert Lewandowski.
Manager Xavi is understood to see the Gabon striker as a slightly different option to the Poland captain, but the financial aspect of re-signing him from Chelsea will not be straightforward - and Firmino will be a free agent when his Liverpool contract expires on July 1.
Aubameyang is understood to have remained a consummate professional at Stamford Bridge having been told he would not be part of previous boss Graham Potter’s plans, and being omitted from their squad for the Champions League knockout stages.
The 33-year-old's attitude is said to have remained first class and he has trained well with the intention of still trying to win a place in the team, having come off the bench in the games against Tottenham and Wolves this year.
Aubameyang is still not part of Chelsea’s long-term plans however, and they are happy for him to move on this summer in what is expected to be a significant clear-out of players due to the number of additions they made in the last two transfer windows.
Barca were keen to bring Aubameyang back to the club in January but were unable to commit the necessary funds.
The club are trying to negotiate more flexibility with LaLiga for next season, which they hope will also include the return of Lionel Messi, but they remain at the limit of their financial fair play capacity as things stand.
Firmino’s status as a free agent, having announced earlier this year he would be leaving Anfield, therefore brings him into play as another serious option, along with another impending free agent, Borussia Monchengladbach's Marcus Thuram.
Barca’s list also contains the 18-year-old Athletico Paranaense striker Vitor Roque.
Aubameyang, whose situation is also being monitored by clubs in Italy and Germany, is understood to be keen on a return to Barca, and the intention is to work towards this outcome in the coming weeks, with his Chelsea contract still having a year left to run.
The former Arsenal forward has not enjoyed a happy return to London with Chelsea, scoring three goals in 20 appearances in all competitions - 10 of which have been starts.
Aubameyang joined the Blues from Barcelona for £10.3m last summer after a productive spell at the Nou Camp during the second half of the 2021/22 season, scoring 13 goals in 24 games in all competitions.

Messi apologizes to PSG for unapproved Saudi Arabia trip
PARIS — (AP) — Lionel Messi apologized to Paris Saint-Germain and his teammates on Friday for going to Saudi Arabia on an unauthorized trip that resulted in his suspension.
Messi posted a short video on Instagram to ask for forgiveness and chalk up the controversy to a scheduling misunderstanding.
He missed practice on Monday while he was on a promotional trip to Saudi Arabia, and a day later the French club announced it suspended the World Cup winner.
Messi said he thought the team had Monday off.
“Hello, I wanted to make this video about what is happening. First of all, ask for forgiveness from my teammates and the club. Honestly, I thought we were going to have an off day as it had been the case in the weeks prior. I had this trip to (Saudi) Arabia organized, which I had canceled before, and this time I couldn’t cancel. Again, ask for forgiveness from what I did and I will be waiting for whatever the club decides. Hugs.”
Earlier on Friday, coach Christophe Galtier said the club and Messi will wait until the end of his suspension to discuss how he finishes the season.
Messi is not expected to extend his contract, and there are only five games remaining.
Galtier was asked at a news conference if he'll be able to count on Messi returning to the field after the suspension.
“We'll see when Leo returns what will happen,” Galtier said. “Obviously, there will be discussions with the entire club but also with Leo, who is the primary person involved.”
The club hasn't confirmed the length of the Argentina great's suspension but French media reported it to be two weeks, which would mean he'd miss two games. PSG has a five-point lead over second-placed Marseille in Ligue 1.
Galtier said the club told him that Messi was suspended, and he declined to say if he endorsed the decision.
“I did not have to make the decision," the coach said. "I was informed of the decision.”
Messi joined PSG in 2021 after winning every major honor with Barcelona. The Catalan club that Messi called home from the age of 13 couldn't afford to keep him because of large debts and Spanish league financial regulations.
The French club and its fans hoped Messi's arrival would result in an elusive Champions League title. Instead, the Qatari-backed club was eliminated in the round of 16 in consecutive seasons.
Messi was welcomed into Paris with a police escort. His exit is sure to be less glorious. Reports have linked Messi to Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, a return to Barcelona, and a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia.
Some PSG fans are also urging forward Neymar to leave the club.
For Galtier, though, fans crossed the line when they protested outside the Brazil international's residence this week.
“Private life must remain private,” he said. “I can understand the anger, the disappointment of our fans. I can understand protesting here at our workplace, in front of PSG's headquarters, after a match at Parc des Princes.”
But going to private homes is “out of control and dangerous," he said.
Neymar had season-ending surgery on his right ankle in March.

Manchester City are on the verge of a historic treble. Here's how they got there
Manchester City are nine games away from the treble. Their manager, Pep Guardiola, doesn't want to talk about it, and it's a feat that has only been achieved once before in English football by Manchester United in 1999, but City have given themselves the opportunity to lift the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup in the same season.
Guardiola and his team have got a lot right, but have also had obstacles to overcome and still face tough games in the run-in, particularly against Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinals and Manchester United in the FA Cup final. Completing the treble this season would write City's class of 2022-23 into the history books, and could also trigger an era of dominance at home and abroad that few teams have managed before. So as City chase the treble, here is a breakdown of their ups and downs this season, their remaining fixtures and whether they can triumph on all three fronts.
What's gone right?
The obvious place to start is Erling Haaland. In the past, big signings like Rodri and Jack Grealish have taken a year to settle, but Haaland is only nine months into his City career and has already scored 51 goals in all competitions.
On occasion at the start of the season, Guardiola suggested his players were still trying to figure out the best way to find him but the Norwegian striker scored on his Premier League debut against West Ham in August and hasn't stopped. Crucially, Haaland has also stayed fit. He only managed 30 appearances in all competitions for Borussia Dortmund last season, but at City he's missed just three games through injury.
City have done a good job of keeping other key players healthy. Ruben Dias, Phil Foden, John Stones, Kyle Walker, Aymeric Laporte and Kalvin Phillips have all had short spells on the sidelines, but for most of the season Guardiola has had a fully fit squad to choose from. They've also hit form just at the right time. City are now on a run of 14 wins from their last 15 games, building momentum at the perfect point in the campaign.
What problems have they faced?
It's not all been plain sailing. The squad revamp last summer was larger than expected after Raheem Sterling left for Chelsea and Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko signed for Arsenal. City had more players at the mid-season World Cup in Qatar than any other club in Europe, and in January Joao Cancelo was a shock departure when he left for Bayern Munich on loan, leaving Guardiola with Nathan Ake -- usually a centre-back -- as the first-choice left-back.
Then, in February, the club were charged with more than 100 breaches of the Premier League's financial rules. It caused enough uncertainty within the squad that director of football Txiki Begiristain addressed the players in a meeting to address their concerns. City insist they are innocent of any wrongdoing, though the legal process could take years to run its course and the range of punishments if found guilty -- everything from points deductions to relegation -- could create uncertainty.
The news broke while City were in the middle of an inconsistent run of five wins from 10 games in all competitions, which included league defeats at Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. After a 4-2 win over Spurs in January in which City were forced to come back from 2-0 down, Guardiola accused his players of being "happy flowers" and questioned whether his team had the drive and determination to compete with Arsenal for another title. It turns out that they do.
Could they win the treble?
The simple answer is yes. Guardiola is a fan of saying that doing the treble in England is almost impossible because only Manchester United in 1999 have managed to achieve it, but City are just nine games away. With Chelsea in disarray, the biggest obstacles in the title race run-in are back-to-back away games against Brighton and Brentford in the space of four days at the end of May. Guardiola has already highlighted the danger posed by Brighton, a team he says are the "best in the world" in the way they build up their play.
Meanwhile, Real Madrid stand in the way of a second Champions League final in three years. Guardiola won't take anything for granted after the dramatic semifinal exit at the Bernabeu a year ago. City dominated long spells of that tie, winning 4-3 at home only to lose in Madrid with three goals after the 90th minute; they'll fancy their chances of getting the job against the Spanish giants this time around.
The FA Cup final against Manchester United on June 3 is a complication because any Manchester derby is a frantic, fraught occasion and a first cup final between the two teams will be electric. City won 6-3 at the Etihad in October and lost 2-1 at Old Trafford in January. City will start as favourites, but it's never that simple.
What happens next?
The worrying thing for the rest of England and Europe is that whether City win the treble or not, there are plans to strengthen over the summer. Two midfielders could arrive, although Real Madrid have jumped ahead in the race to sign long-standing target Jude Bellingham. There was interest in Ben Chilwell before he signed a new contract at Chelsea, and City will also try to sign a left-back if the right opportunity emerges. They have already been linked with Alphonso Davies at Bayern Munich and Theo Hernandez at AC Milan.
We are already in a period of City dominance and it doesn't show any sign of ending. Guardiola's team have won the Premier League -- considered the toughest domestic championship in the world -- in four of the last five years and have reached at least the semifinals of the FA Cup each year since 2019.
The Champions League is historically unpredictable, but City have now reached at least the last four in three consecutive seasons and whatever happens between now and this year's final in Istanbul in June, they will start next season's campaign as favourites.
City have flirted with the treble before and if they're even stronger next season, challenging for Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup at the same time could start to look routine.

Why Napoli's first Serie A title since 1989-90 means so much to the city and its fans
More than a roar, it was a rumble -- a build-up toward the inevitable: tension and release. It's fitting for a city that rises between the steaming volcanic plumes of Mount Vesuvius and the placid azure of the Gulf of Naples, dotted with ferries to the one-percenters' island playground of Capri.
- Napoli clinch first Serie A title since 1989-90
- Reaction: The city of Naples goes wild with celebration
Victory comes in many forms, but this time it wasn't a close finish; it was a double-digit length saunter, a crescendo towards the inevitable. This most superstitious of cities was more than happy to stare down karma. Even before Christmas, it set to work festooning its streets and alleys with blue and white banners with the number "three" -- as in the number of titles won counting this one, which was only conquered on Thursday with a come-from-behind 1-1 draw at Udinese. They perked up the piazzas long decorated with shrines and murals to the man who had led them to their only two other Scudetti in the late 1980s: Diego Armando Maradona.
And when the referee blew for full-time in Udine, after Victor Osimhen (who else?) fired home his 22nd league goal of the season to give his team the point they needed, the pitch was swiftly overrun by visiting fans and their raw joy. Supporters mobbed their heroes and collected bits of turf as mementos; back in Naples, several thousand packed the Stadio Diego Maradona where they lit flares and celebrated, 500 miles from their champions, while watching on big screens around the stadium. You can bet the festivities will still be going by the time their heroes arrives home.
You can trace this feat back to two broad strands: passion and ingenuity. When it comes to Naples, you're likely more than familiar with the first. This a city where the sport of football is all-permeating, cutting across ethnicities, socioeconomic classes and neighborhoods. Folks speak of fandom as faith, and it makes sense in that context.
This is also a place where religion and the paranormal coexist. Three times a year, Neapolitans gather to venerate a glass orb supposedly containing the dried blood of San Gennaro, the city's patron saint. They chant and pray until the dried substance inside liquefies. Sometimes it does, but sometimes it doesn't, portending rough times ahead. Scientists have their own explanation; the Catholic Church itself stops short of calling it a "miracle" or even of confirming that it's actually San Gennaro's dried blood in the vial. But to those who believe, it's very real.
It's perhaps why Maradona resonated (and still resonates). He understood the fine line between the earthly and the otherworldly and their place in our lives. When he talked about the hand of God pushing the ball over Peter Shilton and into the England goal at the 1986 World Cup, Neapolitans knew what he meant better than most. There's plenty of room for the metaphysical, the unexplained and the inexplicable in this city.
Call it irrational belief if you want, but this is a fan base that has suffered far more than its share of heartbreak and has every reason to believe in curses. In the 1950s, after going on an unprecedented spending spree under then-president Achille Lauro, a shipping magnate, they won nothing and were relegated in 1961. (A brief digression: in 1965, Lauro bought a huge ship and renamed after himself, then converting it into a cruise ship. In 1985, it was hijacked by terrorists; in 1994, it caught fire and sank off the coast of Somalia. Not much luck there, either.)
In the 1974-75 season, Napoli lost the title by two points after being beaten 6-2 by Juventus in front of the the biggest crowd, 90,736, to ever witness a football match on Italian soil. To add insult to injury, the opening goal was scored by the legendary Jose Altafini, who had spent seven seasons leading the line at Napoli (and won a World Cup in 1958 alongside a certain Pele).
In 1987-88, after leading for much of the season, they were rocked by a player rebellion, managed just one point from their final five games and were pipped to the finish by Milan -- a course of events that has prompted countless conspiracy theories to this day. And in 2004, after years of mismanagement, red ink and dubious owners (and nearly getting relegated to the third flight), they finally went bankrupt. They were reformed in the third division a year later and thus began a long, patient march back to the top of the tree.
So, yeah, jinxes and curses are real here. They're baked into the city and the fact that they were so ready to disregard them speaks volumes about the club's achievements this season. All of which brings us to the other strand of their success: human ingenuity.
Naples as a city often gets stereotyped -- and often by folks who have never been -- as a byword for chaos, social ills and mismanagement. But the club itself stands in stark contrast. Over the past decade, they have been both successful on the pitch (seven top three finishes, two Coppa Italia victories) and profitable off it, despite recent heavy losses related to the coronavirus pandemic. That's a stellar achievement, any way you cut it.
This season was supposed to be a transition year. Napoli opted to cut their wage bill by 30% and let arguably their three veteran leaders leave: defensive stalwart Kalidou Koulibaly joined Chelsea, the club's all-time top goalscorer Dries Mertens went to Galatasaray in Turkey, and native son/club captain Lorenzo Insigne moved to Major League Soccer's Toronto FC. Without this trio, they relied on young under-the-radar replacements -- namely Korean central defender Kim Min-jae, Italian winger Giacomo Raspadori and, of course, Georgian sensation Khvicha Kvaratskhelia -- to reorient this team.
You know the story from here. Kvaradona -- as some, coming close to blasphemy in this city, have dubbed him -- leads Serie A in assists and has contributed 12 goals from wide areas, forming a devastating one-two punch with the masked Nigerian center-forward Victor Osimhen, who has 27 goals in 33 appearances across all competitions. (The mask, in case you're wondering, is a legacy of a long-forgotten broken jaw; now it's simply a good-luck charm, which kind of fits the city.)

Those two grab the headlines, but there are success stories throughout the side. Captain Giovanni Di Lorenzo has emerged as one of the best right-backs in Europe. Kim hasn't quite made people ask "Kalidou, who?" but he is filling his big shoes. The midfield trio of Stanislav Lobotka (who didn't start a single game in his first year at the club, two years ago), Piotr Zielinski (a one-time wunderkind only now harnessing his considerable talent on a consistent basis) and Franck Zambo-Anguissa has emerged as one of the best units around.
And how about keeper Alex Meret? In August, many felt he was too insecure, too green and too nice to marshal a back four. Napoli were reportedly in the market for another keeper, only for Meret to prove the doubters wrong.
Here, a ton of credit must go to the man who assembled this squad: sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli, and the man who makes it tick, coach Luciano Spalletti.
Now 64, Spalletti had a reputation as something of a spiky, misunderstood genius -- 15 years ago, at Roma, he pioneered the false nine revival and later become a cult figure, winning titles in Russia at Zenit Saint Petersburg -- who could be difficult to deal with. Maybe it's the wisdom of age, but he scarcely put a foot wrong this season, leading Napoli not just to the title but to a stellar Champions League campaign that saw them win 4-1 over Liverpool and 6-1 at Ajax before exiting in the quarterfinals.
This is planning. This is ingenuity. This is professionalism. And this is pragmatism, too -- all things few would associate with the club, but all things critical to this success. And, in fact, that last factor -- pragmatism -- is emblematic.
For much of the season, the club had been at loggerheads with some of their hardcore "ultras" supporters, who provide much of the tifo on matchdays. The dispute centered around ticket prices, the club's insistence that banners and flags be approved before entering the stadium and the proposed introduction of a "loyalty card." These ultras are unhappy with what they consider to be the commercialisation of the club and owner Aurelio De Laurentiis' desire to make a profit.
This tension came to a head when Napoli hosted Milan in the league last month. During the 4-0 defeat, many ultras refused to sing and support the team, even brawling with other fans who insisted on cheering. It made for an ugly, self-destructive atmosphere that seemed absurd to outsiders, especially coming during the club's biggest season since the Maradona days. This conflict was also overcome with patience, compromise and mutual understanding, resulting in a sort of truce that enabled the city to celebrate the way it did when the title did come. And this was not something to be taken for granted given the egos and stubbornness on both sides (De Laurentiis and the ultras).
Napoli are one of the success stories of 2022-23. More than that, they show how, sometimes, you can in fact, combine oil and water -- that is, irrational passion and rational planning, overwhelming love and cool professionalism -- in order to achieve great things.
As for their superstitions? Well, it can't hurt to have Diego smiling down on you from up high, and maybe even pulling a few strings on your behalf.

Summer transfer predictions: Bellingham to Real Madrid or Man City? Kane to leave Spurs?
Europe's summer transfer window is fast approaching and, with domestic leagues ending within a month, teams are starting to think hard about which players they want to bring in.
With most of the top leagues able to start doing business from July 1 -- England's Premier League opened the 2022 window on June 10 but clubs could only sign players from domestic leagues for three weeks -- it won't be long before the money starts flowing again.
In 2022, Premier League clubs broke the transfer spending record for a season in the summer window alone, spending £1.9 billion ($2.2bn) during the period, according to finance company Deloitte. The previous record of £1.86bn ($2.5bn) for a whole season was set in 2017-18, while it also beat the previous summer spending record of £1.4bn ($1.6bn) set in 2017.
So what could happen this summer? We asked some of ESPN's correspondents and writers for their predictions.
- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)
What one big deal do you expect to happen?
Alex Kirkland: Real Madrid are optimistic of beating Manchester City to the signing of Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jude Bellingham, sources have told ESPN. Negotiations have advanced and Madrid's chief scout Juni Calafat and managing director Jose Angel Sanchez have been key, while Bellingham's desire to make the move to the Santiago Bernabeu has helped Madrid maintain belief that a deal will be possible. Indeed, sources said that City's wage offer to Bellingham is larger so it is down to the 19-year-old to decide. However, Dortmund's transfer valuation of around €150 million won't be met and Madrid are looking to pay around €100m with add-ons.
Whatever happens with Bellingham, Madrid will certainly try to sign a centre-forward. Karim Benzema's injury struggles -- which he now appears to have finally overcome, just in time for the business end of the season -- have left no doubt that Madrid need an alternative to help manage the 35-year-old's body at this stage of his career. Benzema himself, coach Carlo Ancelotti and club executives all agree that a target man is required. A single candidate has yet to emerge, with the club still weighing up a wide range of options. It's a position that Madrid have struggled to fill in the past, though. Remember spending €60m to sign Luka Jovic?
Rob Dawson: Dortmund haven't given up hope of keeping Bellingham and Real Madrid's interest is detailed above, but there is still hope at Manchester City that the England international will be wearing a blue shirt next season. He's seen what manager Pep Guardiola has done for his former teammate Erling Haaland (51 goals in 45 games) and there is no better place in the world to improve as a player and win trophies while you're doing it. Liverpool have already been put off by Dortmund's valuation and City can put together a financial package that very few other clubs can match. If City can sign Haaland, they can certainly land Bellingham.
Julien Laurens: Personally, I think Bellingham will play at the Bernabeu next season. It will be the biggest, most expensive transfer of the window. Real Madrid are still strengthening their midfield and Bellingham is the last piece of the jigsaw. Florentino Perez has the money, and for the player it is hard to turn down a club like Real Madrid.
Mark Ogden: Sources have told ESPN that Lionel Messi will leave Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer this summer and, while there is long-standing interest from former club Barcelona and Major League Soccer side Inter Miami, the financial power of the Saudi Arabian Pro League will see the Argentina captain move to Al Hilal.
The emotional pull of a return to Barcelona may tempt the 35-year-old, but nobody outside a very small circle of executives at Camp Nou believe that Barca can finance the deal -- they might not even believe it themselves. A move to Inter Miami would be a gamechanger for MLS and the club has made no secret of its desire to sign Messi, but again, the financial equation just wouldn't stack up for the league or team.
So unless a major Premier League side are prepared to break their wage structure for a fading star -- his Champions League performances for PSG are a better gauge of Messi's current ability than his 2022 World Cup displays -- then Messi will head to Saudi Arabia to renew his rivalry with Al Nassr's Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi has already made a fortune from his ultra-successful career, but the financial rewards on offer in Saudi Arabia will make it difficult for him to move elsewhere.
Sam Marsden: Messi will leave Paris Saint-Germain when his contract expires, but where will he end up next? Two years after joining the Ligue 1 side, his stay in France is coming to a tumultuous end following a commercial trip to Saudi Arabia while his teammates trained after defeat to Lorient. A two-week suspension followed, pushing him closer to the exit door.
Sources close to Messi insist his preference is to stay in Europe, with a return to Barcelona the most likely option in that scenario. However, how Barca can afford him now, two years after they could not afford to renew his contract, remains a quandary. There is willing on both sides for a deal to happen, but it will be up to LaLiga to green light the numbers involved and allow Barca to register Messi with the league. If not, a move to Saudi Arabia or Major League Soccer may await.
James Olley: This is the summer Harry Kane could finally leave Tottenham. Spurs are reluctant to let him go, understandably, but Kane turns 30 this summer and has one year left on his contract. They have no manager, no director of football and face another summer of transition. Any new head coach would of course want to keep a striker of Kane's calibre but it increasingly feels like the time has come to move on.
Manchester United are the most logical destination but it will interesting to see if former Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino takes the Chelsea job and tries to convince the two London rivals to do business at over £100m. Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain are two overseas alternatives, while Real Madrid want a striker too, but the indications are at this stage that Kane would prefer to stay in the Premier League.
Tor-Kristian Karlsen: With a Messi-shaped hole to fill, Paris Saint-Germain could move for AC Milan forward Rafael Leao. With just one year to run on his contract, and talks over an extension yet to bear any fruit, Milan have their hands tied and the moment to strike a deal is now. He's undoubtedly rated highly by the big-spending Premier League clubs, but it's hard to see him fitting in at Manchester City, while Chelsea have to get their house in order before they can contemplate bringing in another big-name forward.
France striker Marcus Thuram's next move is also an intriguing story to follow. The 25-year-old's contract is coming to an end at Borussia Monchengladbach, which allows him his choice of the top clubs across the continent.
Jon Molyneux-Carter: Chelsea will almost certainly try and sign a striker, and no doubt for big money too. Napoli's Victor Osimhen is reportedly a player who has appeared on the radar of the owners at Stamford Bridge -- as well as Manchester United, Bayern Munich, PSG and Real Madrid -- but would cost upwards of €130m. Even after all their recent spending and with €115m striker Romelu Lukaku's future still unclear after a loan spell at Inter, Chelsea need a No. 9, but it's going to be hard for whoever it is to settle given the history of failure in that position.
Arsenal have had a great season and have also been linked with Osimhen, but are more likely to bring in a central midfielder. The club nearly spent £70m to land Brighton's Moises Caicedo in January and could return for him, or turn attention to West Ham's Declan Rice instead.

Chelsea in advanced talks with Mauricio Pochettino for manager role - source
Mauricio Pochettino is in advanced talks with Chelsea to become manager at Stamford Bridge, replacing interim boss Frank Lampard before the start of next season, a source familiar with the negotiations has told ESPN.
Pochettino, 51, has been out of work since leaving Paris Saint-Germain at the end of last season, but the former Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur manager has now emerged as the favoured candidate to take charge at Chelsea.
- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)
Sources told ESPN that Chelsea's plan is to let Lampard see out the season and then hand the reins to Pochettino in the summer, adding that the Argentine coach feels the project at Stamford Bridge suits him because he will be able to build a young team that can play his style of football.
Pochettino would arrive following a lengthy process to identify a successor to Graham Potter, who was fired after just seven months in charge on April 3. Chelsea had drawn up a short list that included as many as seven names to replace Potter, with former Bayern Munich coach Julian Nagelsmann and Pochettino regarded as initial favourites of the club's owners, Clearlake Capital.
Nagelsmann subsequently dropped out of the running, sources told ESPN on Friday, while talks with former Barcelona and Spain coach Luis Enrique did not progress beyond exploratory discussions.
Sporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim and Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti were also considered by Chelsea, but a source has told ESPN that Pochettino is now in detailed discussions about taking over at the club.
Pochettino was interviewed for the Manchester United manager's job last season and made the final two before missing out on the post to Erik ten Hag. He was also interviewed by Chelsea following the sacking of Thomas Tuchel, whom he succeeded at PSG in January 2021, before missing out to Potter.
Despite Lampard guiding Chelsea to four successive defeats during his reign as interim manager, sources said the club would let him see out the remainder of the current campaign.
And Pochettino, who took Spurs to the Champions League final in 2019, is now close to becoming the next permanent manager at Stamford Bridge.
Pochettino had also been heavily linked with a return to Tottenham, who are also searching for a manager following the dismissal of Antonio Conte in March and the sacking of his interim successor, Cristian Stellini, on Monday following a 6-1 loss to Newcastle on Sunday.

Transfer Talk: West Ham's Declan Rice tops Arsenal list with Mikel Arteta given a £150m budget
The transfer window may be closed around Europe, but teams are looking ahead to the summer and there's plenty of gossip swirling around. Transfer Talk brings you all the latest buzz on rumours, comings, goings and, of course, done deals!
TOP STORY: West Ham's Rice tops Arsenal's list
Arsenal will hand Mikel Arteta a £150 million transfer budget to bring in three key players with West Ham United defensive midfielder Declan Rice the priority for this summer, according to the Independent.
Rice, 24, is reported to be the first signing that the Gunners will attempt this summer, with the Premier League side also looking to add a defender and a striker.
While the England international's contract is set to enter its final year in June, the Hammers have the option to activate a clause that would extend his stay at the London Stadium by a further year. ESPN sources revealed that David Moyes' side would be looking for a fee of £100m before agreeing to offload him.
Arsenal are also said to be interested in Brighton's Moises Caicedo, Bayer Leverkusen winger Moussa Diaby, and Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi.
Meanwhile, the Times claims that West Ham could move to bring in Manchester City's Kalvin Phillips as Rice's replacement.

Bayern Munich sack coach Julian Nagelsmann, hire Thomas Tuchel amid Bundesliga struggles
Bayern Munich have announced the sacking of manager Julian Nagelsmann and the arrival of his successor, Thomas Tuchel.
Nagelsmann has been relieved of his duties, with the club just one point off top spot in the Bundesliga and days ahead of a Champions League quarterfinal showdown with Manchester City.
- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)
The move also comes ahead of Bayern's season-defining clash with league leaders Borussia Dortmund on April 1 (stream live on ESPN+ at 12:30 p.m. ET).
ESPN reported on Thursday that Bayern had dismissed the former RB Leipzig coach and were ready to bring in former Chelsea boss Tuchel as a replacement. The club confirmed the news on Friday.
"FC Bayern Munchen has released head coach Julian Nagelsmann," Bayern said in a statement.
"This decision was taken by CEO Oliver Kahn and board member for sport Hasan Salihamidzic in consultation with club president Herbert Hainer. Nagelsmann will be succeeded by Thomas Tuchel. Tuchel will receive a contract until 30 June 2025 and will supervise squad training for the first time on Monday.
"Along with Nagelsmann, assistant coaches Dino Toppmoller, Benjamin Gluck and Xaver Zembrod have also been released."
Bayern hired Nagelsmann in April 2021, and he led them to their 10th successive Bundesliga title last season. The club finished the season eight points ahead of second-place Dortmund.
However, the German coach has not managed to maintain the club's usual standards of dominance in domestic football. Bayern are just four points above third-place Union Berlin.
Bayern were defeated 2-1 by Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday, allowing Dortmund to leapfrog them into first place.
Nagelsmann has led the club to the Champions League quarterfinals this season, twice defeating Paris Saint-Germain while also dispatching LaLiga leaders Barcelona.
The Bundesliga champions face Premier League champions City in the quarterfinals on April 11.

Man City charged by Premier League for multiple financial fair play breaches
Manchester City have been charged by the Premier League over breaking financial rules across nine seasons, the league announced on Monday.
The Premier League confirmed that a number of alleged breaches between the 2009-10 and 2017-18 seasons have been referred to an independent commission with the conclusion of a four-year investigation.
The commission will be held in private and can impose open-ended sanctions, which could include fines, points deductions or relegation from the Premier League.
- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)
A Premier League statement read: "In accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1, the Premier League confirms that it has today referred a number of alleged breaches of the Premier League Rules by Manchester City Football Club to a Commission under Premier League Rule W.3.4."
City have been charged with more than 100 breaches of rules that required the club, according to the Premier League, to provide "accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club's financial position."
City have also been accused of failing to cooperate with the investigation.
In response, City issued a statement on Monday that read: "Manchester City FC is surprised by the issuing of these alleged breaches of the Premier League Rules, particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the EPL has been provided with.
"The club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent Commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position.
"As such we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.
Sources close to City have told ESPN they are disappointed they did not get prior warning before the Premier League statement on Monday and believe it was rushed out ahead of the expected publication of a white paper on football governance later this month.
Club sources also believe they would have won the appeal against the ban from European competition regardless of the time limit on evidence and remain certain they will not be found guilty of the Premier League charges by the independent commission.
City have previously branded the Premier League investigation as "resulting from the illegal hacking and out of context publication of club emails."
It refers to a report by German outlet Der Spiegel published in November 2018.
In July 2020, City had a two-year suspension from UEFA club competitions overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after initially being found guilty of "serious breaches" of financial fair play regulations between 2012 and 2016.
City were first charged by UEFA in March 2019, prompting the Premier League to launch their own investigation.
In their verdict clearing City, CAS ruled that much of the evidence had fallen outside of a five-year time limit. The Premier League have not been bound by the same limit.
Last season, City won their sixth Premier League title since their takeover in 2008. Roberto Mancini managed the club to a league title in 2011-12 before a Manuel Pellegrini-led City side won the league in 2013-14.
Pep Guardiola has guided the club to three league titles since his appointment in 2016.
They have also won two FA Cup titles and five League Cup trophies since their Abu Dhabi owners City Football Group took over the club.
Guardiola's side sit second in the Premier League table this season, five points behind leaders Arsenal.

Chelsea sign Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Barcelona for €12 million
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is returning to the Premier League after Chelsea completed a deal to sign the forward from Barcelona for a fee of €12 million, the clubs announced on Thursday.
Aubameyang has signed a two-year contract at Stamford Bridge.
The 33-year-old only joined Barcelona in January on a free transfer from Arsenal, but was relegated to a backup role following the arrival of Robert Lewandowski.
- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)
Despite that, manager Xavi Hernandez was still keen to keep the striker, but the Catalan club's need to raise money to invest in other areas, coupled with their depth in attack, forced them to consider offers.
"I'm really happy. It's an honour to be part of this team and I can't wait to start," Aubameyang told Chelsea's website. "I have some unfinished business with the Premier League so it's good to be back and really exciting."
Shortly following Aubameyang's arrival, Chelsea also announced the signing of Juventus midfielder Denis Zakaria on loan for the rest of the season. The deal includes an option to make the move permanent next summer.
Aubameyang was the victim of an armed assault by a gang at his home in Barcelona earlier this week in which he and his wife were handcuffed and tied up. Sources have told ESPN the striker will be out of action for around three weeks after he was left with a broken jaw following the incident.
He will return to London, where he spent four years playing for Arsenal, and will be reunited with coach Thomas Tuchel, who he previously played under at Borussia Dortmund. He will become part of a new-look Chelsea attack, which also features Raheem Sterling, following the summer departures of Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner.
"Pierre-Emerick is an elite striker with a proven track record in the Premier League and his arrival strengthens our squad, giving us new attacking options," Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly said. "We are thrilled to have Pierre-Emerick on board with us in the new era at Chelsea and we're really looking forward to working with him."
Aubameyang's spell in Barcelona was brief but fruitful. He scored 13 goals for the Blaugrana in all competitions, including 11 in 17 league games as he helped them finish in second place and qualify for the Champions League last term.
The former Gabon international had signed for Barcelona on the final day of the transfer window in January on a free transfer after Arsenal agreed to rescind his contract. During his time with Arsenal, he scored 92 goals in 163 games, including three in seven outings against his new side Chelsea.
Prior to joining Arsenal, the striker had a successful five years at Dortmund, netting 98 goals in 144 appearances for the German club.
On a busy final day of the transfer window for Chelsea, the club also announced that defender Marcos Alonso's contract was terminated by mutual consent. The Spain international, who spent six years with Chelsea, is set to join Barcelona.
Chelsea also confirmed the departures on permanent deals of Billy Gilmour and Kenedy to Brighton and Real Valladolid, respectively.

Lionel Messi to leave PSG: Angry fans in Paris storm club headquarters and Neymar's doorstep in protest
Fans expressed their displeasure with Neymar, Marco Verratti and chief Nasser Al-Khelaifi in addition to Messi
Paris Saint-Germain fans aren't thrilled with the status of their club and some showed as much on Wednesday with a protest of Lionel Messi, Neymar and more. Some fans were calling for Neymar and Marco Verratti to join teammate Messi in leaving the club as well as chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi as they gathered outside of the club offices and Neymar's house. Fans of the French champions have grown more vocal in recent weeks with Christophe Galtier's team in poor form, having been bounced easily from the Champions League, while also struggling at times in Ligue 1. 
Also, Messi is on his way out of the club and has been suspended as well as fined for his unauthorized commercial trip to Saudi Arabia with his family. Les Parisiens' supporters are widely recognized as one of Europe's most passionate and vociferous fanbases with the Parc des Princes atmosphere a source of envy for many clubs. 
That emotion was poured into a few hundred ultras assembling outside of PSG headquarters for a midweek show of dissatisfaction towards the club. They lived up to their billing with an emotional display of chanting and heavy use of flares not too dissimilar to the scenes which greeted Messi's arrival. 
Just 24 hours after Messi was punished for his commercial trip to Saudi Arabia with his family in the wake of the 3-1 loss at home to Lorient in Ligue 1, Neymar, Verratti and Al-Khelaifi were targeted. Neymar even took to social media to say that the PSG ultras had paid him a visit before they moved on to the club's Boulogne-Billancourt HQ.
The PSG fans were vocal in their unhappiness with not just Messi but the direction of the club as a whole and the perceived focus on celebrity and business. The French capital outfit's leadership were invited to step down with ticket prices, the situation regarding Parc des Princes and certain individuals' "parasitic" attitudes all called out in a very public communique which slammed Qatari ownership: "QSI, you bought a soccer club ... Play soccer!"
PSG took their time to react to the events before publishing a statement which condemned the ultras' "intolerable, insulting and shameful" behaviour: "PSG most strongly condemns the intolerable and insulting actions of a small group of individuals that took place on Wednesday," read a club communique. "Whatever the differences of opinion, nothing justifies such actions. The Club gives its full support to its players, its staff and all those targeted by such shameful behaviour."
Messi was an obvious target with this week's news about his suspension and fine after weeks of targeting the Argentine FIFA 2022 World Cup winner. However, the PSG support also came back to Neymar after protests against the Brazilian before as well as turning on former darling Verratti for his similarly unprofessional lifestyle habits.
"I can understand their anger and their disappointment," said Galtier on Friday ahead of Sunday's trip to Troyes. "They can protest in front of here, where we work, or the club's headquarters, or after a match. However, I do not accept them going directly to a player's home.
"I was informed by the management at the start of the week of the decision to suspend Leo," added the French tactician. "I have taken the responsibility not to comment on it. We will see when Leo comes back. Obviously there will be discussions with the entire club, but also with Leo who is the most important person in the situation."

Erling Haaland, Julian Alvarez send Manchester City to top of Premier League with battling win at Fulham
For the first time since mid-February, Manchester City are back at the top of Premier League. It is surely where they will conclude this season even if the fighting display of Fulham in their 2-1 defeat was a reminder that they will not often have it easy.
Still, when there are game-changers of Julian Alvarez's quality in reserve it is hard to see what can stop City from a third straight title, a fifth in seven years. In just his eighth Premier League start, the Argentine international carried the day for the champions-elect, winning a penalty and delivering a strike sufficiently sublime to propel any team to the Premier League summit. 
Shorn of Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva, any other team might have struggled to click into gear, even against a Fulham side who had been sauntering their way towards the end of the season. Not City, however, who burst out of the traps thanks to the irrepressible Alvarez, the World Cup-winning forward who stands as a permanent reminder of the gaudy depth Pep Guardiola has at his disposal.
It is not just about having good players though. City's parts are interchangeable, this was the fourth of five Premier League games that Alvarez and Erling Haaland have started together in which they have both scored. The former earned the latter the chance to score his 50th goal of this remarkable first season in England. Alvarez's touch took him away from Tim Ream in the Fulham penalty area, a clip earning City a penalty and a third-minute lead.
City hadn't let a Premier League team draw level after they took the lead since mid-February but they have faced few teams with the fighting spirit Fulham showed today. That was combined with real quality of the sort that saw Harry Wilson flick a long ball into the path of Carlos Vinicius, whose first-time volley left Ederson stranded. The Brazilian has struggled to plug the gap left by Aleksandar Mitrovic, whose eight-game suspension for confronting a referee does not expire until the trip to Southampton on May 13, but this was the sort of cutting-edge Fulham required.
Where others might have wobbled, Manchester City continued to probe. Before the half was out they were back in the ascendancy, Alvarez somehow turning a scrum of three Fulham players around him into space to arc a shot over Bernd Leno and into the top right. The German in the home goal had no chance of getting near that; any time he did have a chance he saved with authority, blocking strikes from Alvarez, Haaland and Rodri.
Leno's excellence gave Fulham hope, as did defending from Ruben Dias and Ederson that verged on the calamitous before the City goalkeeper thrust a paw on the ball as Carlos Vinicius looked to strike. Bobby Decordova-Reid was convinced he had a penalty after grappling with Kyle Walker. Both Simon Hooper and his VAR concluded that the forward had gone down too easily.
City held firm, never really facing any late barrage of pressure, and now find themselves a point clear of Arsenal with a game in hand. The Gunners could retake top spot with a win over Chelsea on Tuesday but they will surely just be delaying the inevitable.

Borussia Dortmund's Jude Bellingham is the next great midfield star and will excel in whatever team he's in
Every top club in Europe wants to steal Bellingham away from Dortmund, here's why
In an era of specialists, Jude Bellingham does it all. It is for that reason above any else that a cavalcade of Europe's top clubs are falling over themselves in the pursuit of his signature this summer.
Liverpool and Real Madrid are at the front of the queue for the England international but the simple reality is almost any team that could afford Bellingham would move heaven and earth if they thought he could be convinced to depart Borussia Dortmund for them. Why? Because Bellingham would be a comfortable fit into any elite level midfield, his underlying metrics suggesting he could excel in just about any role his head coach asked of him, something he is already doing on a regular basis in the Bundesliga. He is just 19 years of age.
In some of the early months of the season, Bellingham tended to occupy one of the deeper midfield positions in Edin Terzic's side, paired with a more natural ball winner such as Emre Can or Salih Ozcan. From there, it would be up to the Birmingham City academy graduate to drive Dortmund up the pitch, whether through his carrying or his passing. In both facet he excels, according to fbref he ranks in the 91st percentile of midfielders in Europe's top five leagues for progressive carries and passes. By his standard the 91st percentile is frankly bog standard, to look at his data set is to see a sea of green, bar charts stretching to the outer limits of the graph, dynamic radars overflowing with quality.
Crucially, Bellingham makes an impact on the stat that counts most of all. To go along with his six assists, the 10 goals he has provided make him Borussia Dortmund's top scorer in all competitions. In part the reason for his best scoring season yet in Germany is that Bellingham has been moved further upfield by Terzic as the season has progressed, but one suspects he could weigh in with plenty of goals as a six, eight or 10. One of his most obvious skills is his ability to draw an opponent, beat them with the dribble and pass and then to keep on going into the penalty area, as he did for this equalizing goal against Sevilla in October.
If one wanted to make the case for Bellingham having already established an aura in his teens, the petrified gaze of three Sevilla defenders would be invaluable evidence. Had they been watching their pre-match scouting reports they would have known to watch out for his late darts into the box. That does not mean they can stop them.
Should Dortmund lose the ball in the attacking third then they can rest assured that Bellingham, who has made more tackles in the attacking third than any other Bundesliga player, will get it back for them. Here is a player who not only weighs in with double figures in goals but also ranks in Germany's top five in terms of tackles and interceptions. Whatever a coach wants, Bellingham delivers and does so in exemplary fashion.
When Pep Guardiola came to praise Bellingham before Dortmund's Champions League games with Manchester City earlier this season it was not the positional intelligence he focused on, the goal output or the tackles. "The quality, everybody knows it," said Guardiola. "The whole package is really good. He was 17 when he arrived [at Dortmund from Birmingham City] but it was not just about his quality, [it was] how he was leading, his kicking, going to the referee.
"This guy was something special in terms of his mentality. Now he is 19 and he is already one of the captains." The teenager from Stourbridge has already led out one of Germany's biggest teams, the European champions of 1997, on four occasions. If he were to stay on that number would surely grow significantly and Dortmund are more than prepared to delay their payday to spend more time with Bellingham.
"With all the respect for Jude and his performance, we have been answering this question since he joined," Terzic said ahead of Tuesday's Champions League round of 16 second leg against Chelsea. "He chose to join us because he knows this can be the perfect step for him and I think we've proven it both ways. He's helping us a lot but I also think that we as a club on that stage are helping him and his career as well.
"We're really happy and delighted that he is part of our team, he's one of our leaders at the age of 19, he stepped through to the English national team as a player of BVB and this is something we're really happy with." And yet Dortmund know that there is an inevitability about this summer. Bellingham arrived in North-Rhine Westphalia as one of world football's brightest young prospects. His current club have helped to mould him into one of the game's best players in his position, the track record of Erling Haaland, Ilkay Gundogan and Jadon Sancho suggests that this is the moment those players move on for a sizeable prices. However much that ends up being there will be several prepared to pay the price. No wonder. Even the loftiest of fees could be a steal for a 19 year old who doesn't even need to grow all that much to be a superstar.

Mauricio Pochettino to Chelsea: Why he makes sense and what former Tottenham and PSG boss must fix
The Argentine is set for a return to the Premier League, but this Chelsea team needs a lot of work
Chelsea are settling on a permanent manager and it's one with extensive ties to the Premier League in Mauricio Pochettino, according to multiple reports. The former PSG, Tottenham, and Southampton boss is set to succeed Frank Lampard who has been interim manager since Graham Potter was fired earlier this month. While the club's shortlist also included Luis Enrique and Julian Naglesmann, it was Pochettino who ended up rising to the top of that list.
At the moment, it's unclear if Lampard would see out the remainder of the season before Pochettino comes in ahead of a busy summer but the club are at least aligning their preferred choice as soon as possible. With roles such as the one at his former club Tottenham also open at the moment, it does make sense for Chelsea to hire a manager sooner than later before other clubs circle and nab their top choice.
Here's what to know:
Time is of the essence 
While the Argentinian manager has struggled to get stars to perform to their expectations, he has been excellent at building up clubs where he can get players to buy in. Featuring academy players and a high-pressing system, Pochettino and Chelsea can be a perfect fit if owner Todd Boehly allows it to be. The Blues aren't 1-2 players away from competing for the title and if they operate as such, this is a move that will go up in flames like hiring Potter. 
Cobham is one of the best academies in the world and Chelsea needs a perspective shift to trust it. Just like his time at Tottenham, Pochettino may not be the coach to lead the Blues to glory but he can help stabilize things before a manager comes in to take things to the next level. But the key word is time because all of this can't be done in a season. There are players who need to be sold over the summer, the question of who will score goals for the club next season remains and what does Mason Mount's future hold?
Boehly's involvement has held the club back so far but if his second chance at getting his manager leads to him taking a step forward, Chelsea could see rapid improvement. Forcing stars on Pochettino won't last but allow him to work with his players and the results will show. There's an argument to be made that no players at Tottenham improved after Pochettino left the club and while that's an indictment on managers who came after him, it does show what he can do. 
Fullback superpowers
Known as the fullback whisperer, Pochettino will play to Chelsea's strengths in Ben Chilwell and Reece James, but more importantly, he'll be able to find and train capable backups. Chelsea's attack sputters when James isn't in the lineup but with Ben Davies, Danny Rose, Kyle Walker, Kieran Trippier, and Serge Aurier, Pochettino was able to make the fullback positions consistent no matter who was in them. At a club where the starting XI is already fluid like Chelsea, knowing what you'll get from two positions is invaluable.
An answer to the Mason Mount question?
On the fringes of Chelsea as of late, Mount has been a player without a position lately. Not really a winger and not really a No. 10, he has struggled to get back into the XI but Pochettino could offer a lifeline if the Blues move to a 4-3-3. Enzo Fernandez has played in more attack-minded roles in Argentina for River Plate and could do so for Chelsea when N'Golo Kante is healthy, allowing Mount freedom in the middle to pull the strings. With support from fullbacks and consistency in the middle, it's an easy way to jog the attack even if a new striker takes time to enter the fray. It feels too early for Chelsea to move Mount elsewhere considering the chaos that they've had everywhere, and if Pochettino sees him as an answer in midfield, it solves a very expensive question. 
A similar situation is the one that Christian Pulisic is in. One of Chelsa's best attackers per 90 minutes played, he needs a clean slate under new management. He knows the pressing game and is able to create for teammates while also taking his own chances similar to other star wingers who have played under Pochettino.

Declan Rice transfer: Arsenal on West Ham midfielder's radar, privately praising Gunners as viable destination
Long thought to be a Chelsea target, Rice has shown recent interest in their London rivals
Arsenal's remarkable rise to the top of the Premier League table has won them a host of admirers in England and beyond. Within that growing number they can count one particularly interesting man, West Ham midfielder Declan Rice.
Mikel Arteta has made the England international his primary target for the summer transfer window, when Arsenal will be looking to strengthen their midfield for what is likely to be their first Champions League campaign since the 2016-17 season. Only a few months ago it would have been hard to imagine the Gunners being a serious contender for Rice, who has been coveted by some of the top sides in England and Europe, but their progress has caught the eye of many.
Sources say that Rice has been speaking of Arsenal in glowing terms to his team mates, pronouncing himself stunned with the progress the north London side has made. Indeed his private comments about the Gunners are said to be even more effusive than those in public, where he labelled them "a top team" that "you can see [are] coached incredibly well" after West Ham's 3-1 loss at the Emirates Stadium on Boxing Day.
Rice's circle have been planning for a move away for West Ham, who are currently battling against relegation from the Premier League. Were they to drop out of the top flight, the Hammers would find it hard to resist a knockdown sale.
Arsenal are confident that they can get their man, who would serve as an immediate rival and long term successor to Thomas Partey and Granit Xhaka, both of whom will be in their 30s when the new season begins. They are unlikely to be alone in their pursuit of Rice, with Manchester United having been tracking him for some time, though for now Casemiro is firmly ensconced as their lodestone in midfield.
Chelsea are also long term admirers of their former academy prospect. For a time it seemed they were the natural club to secure the 24 year old's services but, 10th in the table with a 10 point gap to fourth, they face an uphill task to secure the Champions League football that Rice wants next season.
"One hundred per cent, I want to play in the Champions League," he said in December. "For the last two or three years, I've been saying that. I've been playing consistently well for my club and I feel like I really want to keep pushing. I see my friends here who are playing Champions League and for big trophies."

Antonio Conte and Julian Nagelsmann firings launch coaching carousel: Which teams could swap managers next?
Tottenham are managerless but Real Madrid, PSG, and several Serie A teams could all be looking at changes
There is currently a coaching carousel going on in European soccer with Bayern Munich and Tottenham Hotspur moving at the same time to change their managers which has created an intriguing scenario. Spurs are not the only club assessing their post-Antonio Conte options with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain potentially joining them in the near future which could also bring into play the likes of AS Roma if Jose Mourinho is tempted away.
We take a look at what has been going on of late.
Bayern Munich
Out: Julian Nagelsmann
In: Thomas Tuchel
We know that Julian Nagelsmann has been dismissed and that the German champions have been quick to appoint Thomas Tuchel as their new boss. This was a blow for Tottenham as the German was on their list of potential Conte replacements after leaving Chelsea earlier this season. However, Bayern learned from losing out on Tuchel in the past to PSG and got their man in relatively surprising circumstances considering that they had just knocked the French giants out of Europe. With no obvious rebound option in Germany, though, Nagelsmann being back on the market is interesting for a number of clubs.

Pep Guardiola 'fully convinced' Manchester City 'will be innocent' from Premier League financial breaches
Despite the charges, Guardiola said he now wants to stay as Man City's coach 'more than ever'
It has been quite a week for Manchester City. After losing to Tottenham on Sunday, the team is now under investigation for breaking Premier League financial rules with over 100 charges during a nine-year span. It's uncertain what kind of punishments will be handed out as this investigation pans out, with calls for points deduction, relegation and other sanctions made if the breaches are proven to be true. 
In his Friday prematch press conference ahead of Sunday's clash against Aston Villa, Pep Guardiola became the first Man City official to publicly address the media on the allegations as touched on the team's innocence, his future and everything in between. Manchester City already stated that they are "surprised" by the allegations and added that they welcome the review of their status by an independent commission and Guardiola further doubled down. 
"My first thought is that we've already been condemned. We are lucky to live in a country where everyone is innocent until proven guilty," Guardiola said. "It seems like we have already been sentenced. What is going to happen, I don't know. We have good lawyers and I know we are going to defend our position."

This isn't the first time that City has been hit with financial investigations. The club was initially banned by UEFA from playing European competitions for breaching financial fair play regulations before that ban was overturned by the Court Of Arbitration for Sport in 2020. 
"This happened with UEFA, it is the same, the same articles, the same accusations. We will defend ourselves like what happened in the UEFA situation. The court will dictate what happens," Guardiola said. "I am fully convinced that we will be innocent. Since Abu Dhabi took over the club, it has been like that since day one."
The charges, Guardiola said, also don't influence how he sees his future with the club. "I am not moving from this seat, I can assure you. I want to stay more than ever."
Guardiola also aysserted that his team will be focused on the Aston Villa match, and not the swirling controversy. From a competitive perspective City has very little room to slip up in the race for the Premier League title. They already trail Arsenal by five points despite having played one more match, and the two teams will square off for the first time on Wednesday. Keeping the team in a title race is their goal and if a points deduction or worse comes in the future, that's a bridge to cross when they get there.

Manchester City crush Arsenal and stake a Premier League claim that nobody can touch
A 4-1 thumping of Arsenal means Manchester City are on course to win the title they were always going to win
MANCHESTER -- In the end, it was a wonder that Arsenal took this title race as far as they did. When it came down to a straight 90 minutes in the Etihad ring, they simply could not lay a glove on a side that was technically, tactically, physically, emotionally and intellectually their superior. Manchester City have ascended to a plain that was beyond their comprehension.
For all the talk beforehand of what might have been if only William Saliba had been fit, what wheezes Mikel Arteta might have had up his sleeve to create a gameplan that offered anything other than Rob Holding defending Erling Haaland. None of them would have made the slightest bit of difference. If Saliba were on the pitch, Arsenal would still have lost. The best version of the league leaders at the peak of their powers would have been roadkill. It has taken a while for City to become City. That's why Arsenal had a statistical chance coming into this game. Their best hope next season is that something is wrong with the past, present and future champions. There is no other way to compete with the best coach, the best players and the greatest wealth. 
There were enough errors from the visitors to ease City towards the 4-1 win that confirms their status as champions in waiting. Pep Guardiola hardly needed a helping hand. In the sixth minute, Arsenal's front four had done just about everything you could have asked of them off the ball. A good press had forced John Stones to hit the ball long towards midfield. Holding was on Haaland's case. And then with two touches, he unleashed Kevin De Bruyne, whose dropped shoulder sent Gabriel Magalhaes the wrong way. Look at his stance and he seems bound to drive the ball into the bottom left. Instead, it flew low and hard into the near post. City were on their way.
You could pick at the faults in that goal. For the first of far too many occasions, Thomas Partey was languid in a match that required explosive intensity. When Stones cleared the ball several yards ahead of De Bruyne. By the time it flew into the bottom corner, he was nowhere near the danger area. Aaron Ramsdale might also have felt he could have done better. And yet no team would have punished those half errors, those mini-lapses as brutally as City did.
CBS Sports has a brand new daily soccer podcast, covering everything you need to know about the beautiful game. Make sure to give House of Champions a follow for coverage of the biggest games, stories, transfer news with Fabrizio Romano, and everything else going on in the world's most popular sport.
Mikel Arteta had challenged his side to deliver the perfect game. He was right that that is what it would have taken but the unbearable weight of expectation crushed Arsenal. When Holding was dragged infield, plugging the gap Partey had left behind and Haaland had attacked, he bounced into the air in frustration. It took exceptional scramble defending from Gabriel just to keep De Bruyne from getting his second.
That would come in due time but not before City had raised Arsenal's hopes and dashed them quite expertly. As Haaland bent shots wide that the Etihad thought were in or smashed efforts just too close to Ramsdale, the traveling contingent might just have convinced themselves that something was written in the stars, that it was not meant to end this way. All the more so when Stones had the ball in the net only to see the linesman's flag deny him. On first viewing, it was as clear an offside as you could wish to see until that stray toe of Ben White popped up on the VAR.
It did not get any easier from there on out. This was always going to be a bridge too far for Arsenal but "Mission: Impossible" actually becomes mission impossible when a player as foundational as Partey, who it should be noted was as fully fit as any player can be expected to be at this stage of the season, is a shadow of an approximation of his true self. Martin Odegaard sold him short with a pass but Arsenal's anchorman was flat-footed as De Bruyne stole in, running off the coast of Holding island before rolling the ball into the net.
City could have had as many more as they wanted and though Reiss Nelson and Leandro Trossard offered a spark of something, the latter teeing up Holding for a consolation goal that he really deserved as a salve for the horrendous night he had had, Arsenal never believed they might even get a foothold in this contest. It might at least have been a hopeful note to end it on but Haaland, evidently readying himself for a hot guy summer of L'Oreal adverts and outfits that just fit, would not allow it. Alice band free, he romped through a defense that just couldn't fight anymore.
This title is gone. So is next year's, so long as Guardiola can keep City even vaguely motivated. Unless the Premier League comes down with its full weight if the 100-plus alleged breaches of their rules are proven, it is hard to see what can be done to change the status quo. From here on out the league is City's to lose. The same as it ever was.

Soccer transfer news, rumors: Chelsea chase Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang; Napoli close to Ndombele deal
The Blues are looking for some striker depth and another defender
What's better than catching up on the latest transfer news? Join in as CBS Sports provides the latest updates from around the world and what they mean to your favorite teams. Chelsea continue to be one of the most interesting teams in the market while Spurs may have found homes for Tanguay Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso. Memphis Depay could be heading to Juventus and much more in today's transfer news.
Let's get to the transfer moves:
In the six-yard box
The biggest transfer stories of the day. These are the deals that are happening, or at least on the verge of getting done.
Chelsea chasee depth in attack and in defense
Chelsea continues to be huge players in the transfer market as they're in direct contact over deals for Barcelona striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Leicester City defender Wesly Fofana to improve squad depth, per CBS Sports Soccer Insider Fabrizio Romano. It's clear that the team needs another option at forward after needing two goals from defenders in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham on Sunday, and they've zeroed in on Aubameyang to fill that role. Fofana isn't as much of a need but with Thiago Silva getting older, it's not a bad idea to get his replacement in early if they can affotrd it. Leicester won't let Fofana go easily, but if Chelsea keeps knocking, something may give.
Entering the penalty area
These moves may not be imminent, but there's a lot of transfer fire in all the smoke these players and teams might be blowing.
Napoli are working on a loan for Tanguy Ndombele
After moving from Lyon to Spurs, Ndomeble wasn't able to adjust to life in the Premier League. He spent the second half of last season back on loan to Lyon with the hope that he'd do well enough for the club to buy him back from Spurs, but with that not happening it was back to the market for Daniel Levy. Napoli could secure his services on loan after a verbal agreement between the player and club, per Romano. Marseille were interested but the deal was too complex for them as Spurs want a club to take him on a permanent deal at the end of the loan In his 11 appearances with Lyon last season, Ndombele only registered two assists but he'll hope to better that in Serie A.
Build-up play
These moves might be speculative but they're ones to keep an eye on.
Juventus aim to sign Memphis Depay on a free transfer
Although Barcelona have been able to register their players for the most part, Depay finds himself falling down the pecking order of forwards on the team. In need of a boost to their attack to compete for the Scudetto and in Champions League, Juventus could offer a lifeline.  Depay's representatives are working with Barcelona to terminate his contract, but if they're able to get that done, it seems like the next stop will be Turin.

Lionel Messi Breaks Silence On PSG Suspension For Saudi Arabia Trip
Lionel Messi apologized to Paris Saint-Germain and his teammates on Friday for going to Saudi Arabia on an unauthorized trip that resulted in his suspension.
Messi posted a short video on Instagram to ask for forgiveness and chalk up the controversy to a scheduling misunderstanding.
He missed practice on Monday while he was on a promotional trip to Saudi Arabia, and a day later the French club announced it suspended the World Cup winner.
Messi said he thought the team had Monday off.
"Hello, I wanted to make this video about what is happening. First of all, ask for forgiveness from my teammates and the club. Honestly, I thought we were going to have an off day as it had been the case in the weeks prior. I had this trip to (Saudi) Arabia organized, which I had canceled before, and this time I couldn't cancel. Again, ask for forgiveness from what I did and I will be waiting for whatever the club decides. Hugs."
Earlier on Friday, coach Christophe Galtier said the club and Messi will wait until the end of his suspension to discuss how he finishes the season.
Messi is not expected to extend his contract, and there are only five games remaining.
Galtier was asked at a news conference if he'll be able to count on Messi returning to the field after the suspension.
"We'll see when Leo returns what will happen," Galtier said.
"Obviously, there will be discussions with the entire club but also with Leo, who is the primary person involved."
The club hasn't confirmed the length of the Argentina great's suspension but French media reported it to be two weeks, which would mean he'd miss two games. PSG has a five-point lead over second-placed Marseille in Ligue 1.
Galtier said the club told him that Messi was suspended, and he declined to say if he endorsed the decision.
"I did not have to make the decision," the coach said. "I was informed of the decision."
Messi joined PSG in 2021 after winning every major honor with Barcelona. The Catalan club that Messi called home from the age of 13 couldn't afford to keep him because of large debts and Spanish league financial regulations.
The French club and its fans hoped Messi's arrival would result in an elusive Champions League title. Instead, the
Qatari-backed club was eliminated in the round of 16 in consecutive seasons.
Messi was welcomed into Paris with a police escort. His exit is sure to be less glorious. Reports have linked Messi to Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, a return to Barcelona, and a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia.
Some PSG fans are also urging forward Neymar to leave the club. For Galtier, though, fans crossed the line when they protested outside the Brazil international's residence this week.
"Private life must remain private," he said.
"I can understand the anger, the disappointment of our fans. I can understand protesting here at our workplace, in front of PSG's headquarters, after a match at Parc des Princes."
"But going to private homes is out of control and dangerous," he said.
Neymar had season-ending surgery on his right ankle in March.

Erling Haaland didn't just break the EPL scoring record, he's destroyed it
Erling Haaland is officially the king of the English Premier League.
The 22-year-old striker, who joined Manchester City in the summer from German side Borussia Dortmund, netted his 35th goal of the season on Wednesday against West Ham, breaking Alan Shearer's all-time reacord of 34 goals in a season, which has stood since 1995.
Haaland started scoring in bunches as soon as he landed in the Premier league.
Nine of his goals came from netting an EPL-first three consecutive home match hat tricks earlier this season – first against Crystal Palace, then Nottingham Forest, and then City's great rival, Manchester United.
With that breathtaking start to the year, Haaland set an astonishing pace, and breaking the all-time record looked far more an matter of when than if.
On Wednesday we got our answer — Haaland needed just 33 matchdays to break Shearer's record, and still has five matches left to play to push the record higher and higher.
When you look at Haaland's scoring through the season compared to the other best seasons in EPL history, he clearly stands a cut above the competition.
Haaland began his career with in his home country with Bryne before moving to fellow Norwegian club Molde FK at 16, where he would score 20 goals in 50 matches.
He moved to Austrian team RB Salzburg in January 2019, where in just one year, he scored 29 goals, including five hat tricks and six goals in the Champions League – form that prompted Borussia Dortmund to come calling before the turn of the year.
For Dortmund, even despite struggles with injury during the last of his two-and-a-half seasons in Germany, Haaland scored 86 goals in 89 matches. 
Haaland also boasts an extremely impressive scoring record for his country, having netted 21 goals in 23 matches for Norway.
For all of the goals he's already scored, Haaland is still just 22 years old.
After his ridiculous start to the season, Haaland received support from some of EPL's greatest players in his quest to break the record set by Shearer.
"He could be the greatest ever in the Premier League, couldn't he?" the former Chelsea FC and England captain John Terry said of Haaland in September after his hat trick against Manchester United.
"You're trying to compare him with somebody, [but] I've never seen a player so young have that desire to score the goals he's scored.
"He is just relentless."
The former Liverpool FC and England defender Jamie Carragher also said the same of Haaland.
"He just looks absolutely amazing," said Carragher. "We know we've got a great player in the league, but I think we've got something really, really special, where when he's finished his time at Man City or in the Premier League, we'll be taking about him alongside Thierry Henry.
"I think this lad could end up being the best player we've seen in the Premier League, I really do. He's that special and he's made a brilliant start."
Even Shearer himself was Haaland to break his own record.
"My record of 34 goals in a season is under serious threat," the Englishman, who is the EPL's record career goalscorer with 260, said after Haaland's hot start. "If he stays fit, he's breaking it."
Haaland stayed fit, and now he's in the record books.

Napoli wins first Serie A title in 33 years after securing draw at Udinese
CNN
Napoli won its first Serie A title in 33 years after coming from behind to secure a 1-1 draw against Udinese at the Dacia Arena, Udine, on Thursday.
The league title is the club’s first since 1990, when the late Diego Maradona – after whom the team’s home stadium is named – inspired it to the Scudetto.
It’s only the third time Napoli has won Serie A and the club’s success sparked jubilant celebrations among the players and also in the southern Italian city, many of whom had congregated at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.
Sandi Lovric’s shot gave Udinese a first-half lead, but Napoli forward Victor Osimhen made it 1-1 early in the second half, guiding the ball home after Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s shot was saved following a corner.
Osimhen, who is Serie A’s leading goalscorer this season, has been key to Napoli’s success and this was his 22nd league goal of the campaign.
The 24-year-old Nigerian scored his goal in front of the traveling Napoli fans, who celebrated the equalizer deliriously.
Fireworks and flares
Even before kick-off, Napoli fans flooded the streets of Naples with thousands of supporters making their way into the club’s home stadium to watch the action in Udine unfold on big screens.
Others set off fireworks and flares in the streets as crowds gathered together in the hope of watching their side finally secure the title – Napoli had squandered an opportunity on Sunday after it unexpectedly drew against Salernitana in front of home support.
Had Napoli won that game Luciano Spalletti’s side would have become the earliest team to win the Serie A title in history – with six games remaining in the league season.
Thursday’s first-half didn’t go to plan for Napoli, though, when it found itself 1-0 down at the break after Lovric’s brilliant strike in the 13th minute.
But Napoli knew a point would be enough to secure a historic title and came out in the second half rejuvenated, buoyed by the traveling fans who created a brilliant atmosphere inside the ground.
According to the BT Sport broadcast, nearly 11,000 Napoli supporters had traveled to the Dacia Arena to witness such a long-awaited moment for their team.
Those fans were rewarded when Osimhen, so often the hero for Napoli this season, scored the equalizer in the 52nd minute.
The celebrations in Udine were only matched by those back in Napoli with the city exploding with excitement – videos showed flares being let off alongside a light show at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.
The draw was all that was needed for the visitors who left Udine with the biggest prize in Italian football.
Napoli fans ran onto the pitch to celebrate when the referee blew the full-time whistle, with players being mobbed in jubilant scenes.
“Seeing Neapolitans happy is enough to give you a sense of that joy they are feeling,” Napoli coach Spalletti, who at 64 became the oldest manager to win Serie A, told DAZN after the game.
“These people will look to this moment when life gets hard, they have every right to celebrate like this. You feel a bit more relaxed knowing that you’ve given them this moment of happiness.”

Bellingham gives up big money by choosing Real Madrid
Manchester City were offering much more than Los Blancos
Real Madrid in recent years have followed a sporting strategy whereby most of the signings who arrive give up the chance of higher wages and a confirmed starting position elsewhere.
Instead, they arrive at a club surrounded by a history that grows season after season and, above all, at a club with a stability that very few can boast.
This is the path chosen by Jude Bellingham, as Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo, Eduardo Camavinga, Aurelien Tchouameni or Endrick did before, players who opted for a sporting proposal, leaving behind the frenzy of money that can be found in the Premier League or at PSG.
It is not that Real Madrid are not in a position to offer good contracts, but it is true that all these players we have mentioned left behind bigger and better proposals than those made by Los Blancos.
Bellingham, moreover, had the possibility of becoming the Premier League's flagship player. However, the Englishman has opted for the proposal of Real Madrid.
Manchester City offered leadership, to become a reference point, with a salary well above what Real Madrid can pay him, which for the moment does not place him in the top range of the salary scale.
The English club were offering him 15 million euros for each of the six seasons they were proposing to him.
Bellingham knows that the competition at Real Madrid is going to be tough. The immediate transition is not going to happen given the quality of Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, who will continue in white for another season.

Mauricio Pochettino meeting revealed as Chelsea 'blown away' amid Tottenham plea
Mauricio Pochettino is a wanted man as Chelsea close in on appointing him but Tottenham fans make themselves heard
Mauricio Pochettino is still closing in on becoming the next Chelsea manager, football.london understands, but the process is continuing to leave fans uncertain. Frank Lampard prepares to oversee his seventh game since replacing Bruno Saltor as interim head coach against Bournemouth but it is Pochettino's whereabouts and decision that is gaining more attention.
The Argentine has held positive talks with the Blues in the past two weeks but negotiates his own contract without an agent and also has a quartet of fundamental backroom staff to bring with him. He also likes to work on their appointments first. It is making the thorough and exhaustive process of finding a third manager in 12 months for Todd Boehly-Clearlake exactly that.
There is little reason to rush, either. Chelsea have nothing to play for this season and won't be immediately replacing Lampard with Pochettino even if he was to be announced. The longer the wait goes on, though, the more restless Blues fans are getting.
READ MORE: 'No rush' with Mauricio Pochettino, Noni Madueke demand and Bournemouth vs Chelsea concern
There is a worry that Real Madrid could make a move for the 51-year-old should Chelsea and Pochettino stall in talks, especially with the future of Carlo Ancelotti still far from clear despite his defiance that he will be seeing out the final year of his deal. Also in the mix throughout has been the prospect of a return to Tottenham.
Spurs fans have been clamouring for a comeback ever since he was sacked in 2019 and felt that the dismissal of Antonio Conte opened up the chance of their dreams becoming a reality. Daniel Levy and Joe Lewis are yet to take any steps towards that, though, and have set their sights on Julian Nagelsmann, Vincent Kompany and Xabi Alonso instead.
Although it seems that Pochettino won't be back in the hotseat in north London anytime soon, the desire to see him on the touchline for other clubs may well be the kick that both parties are after for Chelsea to get this over the line. If not then the report from the Independent may well make a difference.
It is said that Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is still keen on Pochettino having tried to lure him to the Spanish capital previously. It is Chelsea that stand in prime position to make this deal happen, though, with Todd Boehly said to be 'blown away' by how perfect Pochettino is for the role.
His previous experience in high-maintenence environments mixed with his proven ability to rebuild, work with young players and within an defined club heirarchy all make him a standout candidate.
Meanwhile, former player Ricky Villa has given his verdict on Pochettino and Tottenham, revealing the impact he could yet have on the manager's future. "It's a difficult moment for the club," he told talkSPORT. "I'm not allowed to talk about what happened because I live in Argentina but the club is very strong and I think it will recover very soon.
"Pochettino. Come back Pochettino, we need Pochettino back into the team," he said passionately. "Yes, yes, yes. Call him, another offer. He has to make the decision. He has a little chance to come to Spurs again.
"It's not my decision. It's the decision of the chairman. I meet Pochettino next week and we see what happens. If he's going to Chelsea or waiting for the club."

Declan Rice transfer news updates, reports and rumours with Arsenal, Man City chasing West Ham captain
Declan Rice will be a wanted man in the summer as both Arsenal and Manchester City look to sign the midfielder.
The West Ham captain is currently looking to keep his side in the Premier League while also fighting for the Europa Conference League trophy. David Moyes' men are four points above the drop zone with five games to go in the league, and they face AZ Alkmaar in the semi-final of their European adventure.
Rice is a vital part of the West Ham setup, playing every single minute in the Premier League so far. He also has become an integral figure in Gareth Southgate's England lineup, scoring in the last international break against Italy.
The midfielder seems to be ready to fight for a league title next season, but which club will secure his signature?
Declan Rice to Arsenal: Latest news, rumours
Despite links to Chelsea in previous seasons due to his connection with the club, Arsenal have emerged as favourites to sign Rice. 
According to Football Insider, Rice has no intention to remain at West Ham but would prefer to stay in London next season. Chelsea may opt to let Rice go to a rival after signing Enzo Fernandez in January, but the same cannot be said for Man City.
Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva may leave the reigning champions in the summer, and Pep Guardiola will not want Arsenal to grow even stronger after emerging as title contenders this term.
Rice is said to be a priority signing for Arsenal after strengthening in both the defensive and attacking departments over the past two transfer windows. Newcastle have also reportedly been looking at the England international in recent weeks as they look to invest further in the playing staff.
How much would Declan Rice cost?
The valuation of young English players in the Premier League has been high over the last few windows. Jack Grealish moved to Man City for £100 million in 2021, Ben White moved to the Gunners for £50m, and Morgan Gibbs-White cost Nottingham Forest £42.5m.
West Ham manager David Moyes said he expects Rice to break the British transfer record whenever he leaves the Hammers. The British transfer record was broken by Chelsea in January when they bought Fernandez for £106 million. 
According to CIES Football Observatory, who analyse the football market, Rice is valued at close to £70 million. It is unlikely that West Ham would settle for that fee due to the nature of recent signings by the 'big' clubs in the country.
Declan Rice wages, salary, contract
Spotrac reports that Rice earns £60,000 per week after signing a five-year contract, with a further one year option, with West Ham back in the 2018/19 season.
This means that Rice currently earns over £3 million as an annual salary with the London club. The 24-year-old reportedly turned down an eight year contract last year that would have been worth £83m. 
Rice's contract runs out at the end of next season, but West Ham could extend it until 2025. Usually a player entering the final year of their contract would see their value decrease, but the Hammers are unlikely to go lower than £85m due to the potential of the player.
Do Arsenal need Declan Rice?
A problem for Arsenal in recent seasons has been their lack of depth in midfield, especially in the more defensive area. 
Thomas Partey has struggled with injuries since joining Arsenal back in 2020. He only missed seven matches in five seasons at Atletico Madrid, but has been sidelined 37 times due to injury for the Gunners. Mohamed Elneny has missed 34 games this season alone because of a thigh problem followed by a long-term knee injury.
Rice has played every single minute in the Premier League this season for West Ham, just one of three outfield players to do so in the league. He has only been absent for 12 league games in the last five seasons.
Partey has also struggled for form in recent games for Mikel Arteta's side. They have fallen behind in the title race after dropping points against Liverpool, West Ham, Southampton and Man City. Jorginho replaced Partey in the Gunners' 3-1 win over Chelsea, which was their first victory since April 1.
Rice can also play in multiple midfield positions, something that Arteta would appreciate. He can play the positions currently occupied by Partey and Granit Xhaka, as well as further up the pitch if needed.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is on the hunt for a new boss after sacking two managers in the last two months. Antonio Conte was dismissed in March and his former assistant Cristian Stellini, who was in charge on a caretaker basis, was shown the door last month.
Ryan Mason is Tottenham's current caretaker manager but is not expected to be appointed on a permanent basis, despite beating Crystal Palace 1-0 at home on Saturday afternoon. That has left Levy to compile a shortlist for the Spurs job.
It's believed Nagelsmann is at the top of that shortlist. The 35-year-old is considered as one of the best young managers in Europe and has previously coached Hoffenheim, RB Leipzig and Bayern Munich, losing his job at the latter club just two months ago.
Despite being sacked by Bayern, Nagelsmann is still on the club's payroll because he was placed on gardening leave when Thomas Tuchel replaced him in March. According to The Telegraph, Nagelsmann will still be on gardening leave come the summer.
As such, Bayern could be owed compensation if Tottenham hire Nagelsmann. It's believed that figure could be in excess of £10m, and Spurs will also need to meet his wage demands. He is reportedly pocketing between €8m (£7.1m) and €9m (£8m) per year at Bayern.
Nagelsmann is interested in the Tottenham job, but the good news stops there for Spurs fans. The German will not consider a job offer until he knows who Tottenham's next director of football will be. Fabio Paratici left the position last month.
Scott Munn was recently appointed as Tottenham's chief football officer, but he is not a replacement for Paratici. Nagelsmann will only accept Tottenham's advances if he believes he can win silverware. Spurs have not lifted a trophy for 15 years.
Nagelsmann will also want clarity over Harry Kane's future. The England captain has just 13 months remaining on his existing deal and is a transfer target for Manchester United. Ironically, Bayern are also interested in the prolific striker, who turns 30 in July.
Where Tottenham finish in the Premier League this season will also have an impact on their managerial search. Saturday's victory against Palace has pushed Spurs up to sixth in the table, although Brighton in seventh are just two points behind them with three games in hand. Mason's side need to finish in the top seven to qualify for Europe.
Nagelsmann has already dropped out of the running to be the next Chelsea manager because the job wasn't right for him, with former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino tipped to succeed current caretaker Frank Lampard.
If Nagelsmann rejects Tottenham, among the other candidates on Levy's shortlist are Feyenoord's Arne Slot and Celtic's Ange Postecoglou, while former Spain manager Luis Enrique has also been linked.
However, Mirror Football understands Levy has given the green light for a move for Xabi Alonso, whose compensation package at Bayer Leverkusen is considerably less than that of Nagelsmann.

What the Premier League’s Financial Fair Play Charges Mean for Manchester City
A drawn-out process awaits, but what’s clear is that the league has made a loud statement by opposing its most successful club of the last decade.
When the news came, it was in a seemingly bland statement that wasn’t even the lead story on the Premier League website. The Premier League had been investigating alleged breaches of its financial regulations by Manchester City for four years, but there had been no prior indication that today would be the day when charges were brought, or that there would be more than 100 alleged breaches. Exactly what they mean, though, or when there could be consequences, remains unclear.
City released a breezy statement, and said it was not concerned. The club insisted it was “surprised” by the news, “particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the EPL has been provided with.” Nonetheless it welcomes the inquiry as “we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.” Which might be more convincing if City hadn’t been charged by the Premier League with a failure to cooperate, the one offense for which it was eventually punished by UEFA.
The club was banned from the Champions League for two years by UEFA in February 2020 for breaches of Financial Fair Play regulations, only for the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to determine on appeal that “most of the alleged breaches were either not established or time-barred.” There is no time-barring in the Premier League regulations, nor is there any recourse to CAS.
City, indeed, was ordered by an arbitration panel to provide documents and other information to the investigation and then lost a challenge to the legitimacy of the panel in the Court of Appeal. “For the Premier League,” the appeal ruling read, “it was submitted that the tactic that the club has adopted has been to make as many procedural applications and complaints as it possibly can to slow the day when it will actually have to provide the information.”
The case will be heard by an independent commission to be appointed by the chair of the Premier League judicial panel, Murray Rosen KC. There could then be an appeal to another commission. This, in other words, could drag on for some time yet.
The timing, though, is interesting, in that the government was due to publish its white paper on the regulation of football on Tuesday, a belated follow-up to last year’s report into football governance by the MP Tracey Crouch. Given one of the prime criticisms of football is that it is unable to govern itself, charging the side that has won four of the past five league titles with more than 100 breaches looks like a statement. Whether that statement is that the Premier League will act when pushed, or that it is capable of applying its own regulations is, like so much else, unclear. The white paper has been pushed back, although the official line is that it is related less to the charges against City than the determination of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to be personally involved.
In theory, the panel has few restrictions in the sort of punishment it could impose. Although it is thought unlikely that City could be stripped of league titles it has already won, it could theoretically be expelled from the Premier League. More realistic, if found guilty, is a large fine and possibly a points deduction for the following season.
But there is another possibility, which is individual clubs pursuing civil actions against City, as Sheffield United did against West Ham in 2007. West Ham had failed to correctly register Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano and when Tevez scored the winner for West Ham at Sheffield United on the final day of the season, it ensured Sheffield United would be relegated while West Ham stayed up. A court awarded Sheffield United £30 million in lost earnings. Dozens of clubs pursuing losses for serial breaches between ’09 and ’18 could conceivably draw billions in compensation.
It may be that clubs fear the precedent that would set, but there is a lot of anger at City, both for how it has distorted the financial model of football and at the allegations it has failed to cooperate with the enquiry. At least one owner of a major Premier League club is known to be considering selling up because it feels it cannot compete with clubs under less financial pressure in an environment in which regulations were perceived as being only loosely enforced.
This, perhaps, is the beginning of a new era. A verdict will take a long time. There will be a lot of cynicism, particularly in the light of what happened with the UEFA case. This could easily be another damp squib. But it may be that, finally, English football is beginning to consider the implications of its largely unregulated model.

Arsenal have had an incredible season - losing to Man City and potentially the Premier League title doesn't change that
The Gunners face arguably their biggest game in a generation on Wednesday against Pep Guardiola's Premier League champions
It’s the game that we’ve all been waiting for. It may not quite be winner takes all just yet, but Arsenal’s trip to Manchester City on Wednesday is certainly starting to feel like that because of what’s gone on during the past few weeks.
After seven straight wins in the Premier League, it looked like Mikel Arteta’s side were making light work of the unexpected position they were in at the top of the table.
But then they hit the bump that many were waiting all season for them to hit, drawing three successive games, at Liverpool, West Ham and at home to Southampton.
And with City finding top gear at the same time, the commanding lead Arsenal had at the top of the table disappeared almost in the blink of an eye.
The Gunners may head to the Etihad Stadium with a five-point advantage over City, but Pep Guardiola’s side crucially have two games in hand.
So a home win on Wednesday night would leave the champions on the verge of a third successive league title and leave Arsenal needing a miracle to end their long 19-year wait to get their hands on the Premier League trophy.
'If you want to be champions, you have to win those matches'
“It's going to be a tough night and challenge,” Arteta said. “But the opportunity is incredible for us. 
“We knew from the beginning, if you want to win the Premier League, you have to go to Spurs and you have to beat them. You have to go to Chelsea and you have to beat them. 
“This is what we've been doing. That's why we are here. Now we have to go to City and we have to beat them. 
“If you want to be champions, you have to win those matches. It's as simple as that.”
Wednesday night is a huge game for Arsenal. There’s no doubt about that.
In terms of the Premier League, it could certainly be described as the biggest game the club has had in a generation.
'Incredible to be in the position we’re in'
The fact that Arsenal are going into a game as big as the one on Wednesday highlights how far they’ve come in such a short space of time. 
And it shows why, whatever happens at the Etihad, this is a season that should be celebrated in north London.
No-one included them in the title conversation when the season got underway, but here they are. Top of the table with May just around the corner.
“We knew from the beginning that City was the team to beat, probably with Liverpool, because of what those teams have done in the last six or seven years,” Arteta said.
“We wanted to close that gap as much as we possibly could, and we are toe-to-toe with them. It’s just incredible to be in the position we’re in.”
A record-breaking campaign
Arsenal go into Wednesday’s game having won 23 of 32 league matches so far this season. No Arsenal side in history has ever won more games at this stage of a Premier League campaign, not even the Invincibles.
And when you factor in that Arteta’s team have drawn their last three matches, that makes it even more remarkable.
They have scored 77 goals during those 32 games. Again, that’s a number that no other Gunners team has even been able to hit at this stage of a season in the Premier League. The closest anyone came was in 2009-10, when Wenger’s side found the net 74 times.
Arsenal have gone so far beyond expectation levels this season and they have given their fans so much to enjoy. They won at Tottenham and Chelsea, they’ve beaten Liverpool and Manchester United, and they’ve reconnected with a fanbase that had fallen out of love with their team.
And of course, barring a collapse of epic proportions between now and the end of the season, they’ve secured Champions League football again for the first time since 2017.
Catching Pep's eye
When the season began in August, Champions League qualification was the aim of everyone at Arsenal. There was no talk of a title bid. It was all about a top-four spot, having been pipped so painfully to the post by Spurs last time out. 
That’s what the target was and it’s a target that was secured a long time ago, albeit not mathematically.
“Mikel changed the structure of the club,” Guardiola said on Tuesday, while discussing Arsenal’s improvement. “He changed a lot of players. He has been supported by the hierarchy of the club and that is why the success is there.
“Arsenal in the last years never was there and this season [they] make another step because all season they have been there. I have been impressed, they have been really good."
The fairy-tale ending?
It’s been a season to remember at Arsenal. There have been so many special moments and Arteta will desperately be hoping there are a couple more to come in the remaining six games, starting at the Etihad on Wednesday.
But if things do not go their way and City go on and claim yet another title, there will be nothing for Arsenal to feel ashamed about.
They’ve exceeded all expectations and given their fans so much to enjoy. It’s been a remarkable story. One that no-one expected.
It now remains to be seen whether it gets the fairy-tale ending it perhaps deserves.

PIERRE-EMERICK AUBAMEYANG APPROACHES BARCELONA OVER JANUARY RETURN FROM CHELSEA AFTER JOAO FELIX ARRIVAL - PAPER ROUND
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang could make a surprise return to Barcelona in January after less than five months at Chelsea and is "willing to play for almost nothing". Elsewhere, Manuel Neuer's injury could be worse than originally feared, Unai Emery is hoping to reunite with Matteo Guendouzi at Aston Villa and Graham Potter held a "crisis meeting" with his senior squad members at Chelsea.
DEJA VU FOR AUBAMEYANG
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has approached his former club Barcelona in a bid to return to the Camp Nou in January. The Chelsea forward has fallen out of favour under Graham Potter in west London and the arrival of Joao Felix on loan from Atletico Madrid seems to have sealed his fate. Aubameyang is not allowed to play for a new club until next season – as per FIFA rules – as he has featured for Barca and Chelsea already this season so has offered his services to the Catalan club. Sport state that the 33-year-old would “accept whatever they can pay him” and Chelsea would not pay any of his salary if he returned to the Camp Nou on loan.
Paper Round’s view: Aubameyang has been at Stamford Bridge for less than five months and is already desperate to return to Barcelona. You can feel slightly sorry for him because he was convinced to join by his former Borussia Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel… who was sacked by the Chelsea board just five days later. It seems like Aubameyang’s desired return to Barcelona hinges on the exit of Memphis Depay in the winter transfer window. Memphis has recently been linked with a loan move to Atletico Madrid as Felix’s replacement. So Aubameyang could replace Memphis at Barca, while Memphis replaces Felix at Atleti and Felix replaces Aubameyang at Chelsea…
Read the full story
NEUER’S NIGHTMARE
Manuel Neuer’s injury could be worse than first feared, according to reports in Germany. AS (via Bild) believe that the original injury report was downplayed as a “lower leg fracture”. However, it is now being reported that Neuer has suffered "an open fracture of the tibia and fibula", which would mean he would be sidelined for a much longer period of time and could even force the German goalkeeper into early retirement. AS report that this news has thrown Bayern Munich into the transfer market to try and a long-term replacement for Neuer. The Bundesliga leaders have made Borussia Monchengladbach stopper Yann Sommer their number one target but need to improve on their initial €5-million offer.
